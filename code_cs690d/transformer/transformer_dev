When I was in my lab , I had my first research patient .
I was a student student and studied @@UNKNOWN@@ psychology at Stanford .
She was a @@UNKNOWN@@ woman called @@UNKNOWN@@ .
When you started in the first meeting , she had to stand up with me , and she was a top top . She fell on the @@UNKNOWN@@ in my office , @@UNKNOWN@@ her @@UNKNOWN@@ of her , and she
And when I heard that , I was sorry .
My @@UNKNOWN@@ got a @@UNKNOWN@@ as a first patient .
And I got a woman in the 1960s that talk about guys .
I get that I thought .
But I did n't do it .
With the funny stories that were talking about in the last time , it was easy for me , with the head of @@UNKNOWN@@ , during the problems of us .
" 30 is the new 20 , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I could just say that it could be right .
The work came later later , came up later , children later later , and the death later later .
People in the 1970s , like , and I had nothing than time .
But I 'm going to talk about my dad , @@UNKNOWN@@ in the game .
I thought about it .
I said , " Yeah , she 's close with men with her level , she sleep with a @@UNKNOWN@@ , but she wo n't get married . "
And I said , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , " but not the next one .
And it 's the best time to talk about God , who is before she is married . "
This is what 's called a psychologist moment .
That was the moment that I realized that was not 30 of the new 20 .
Yeah , people would go back to later , when they did , they did n't go back to @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And she was going to show you the ' 60s , and we sat down there , and I went down .
And I realized that this kind of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ was a serious problem with real consequences .
At that point , there is 50 million people in the United States .
We talk about about 15 percent of the population , or 100 percent , if you do n't realize that nobody is going to die , without through the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ if you 're in your brain .
I want to see some of you .
Oh , yeah ! You are all incredible .
If you work with someone in the middle , a love , because of a sleep in the middle of you , I want to look at you -- this is great . People are really important .
My name is people in the 1990s , because I believe that every single one of these 50 million people should know what some @@UNKNOWN@@ , and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , you know , the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ is one
This is not my opinion . These are facts .
We know that 80 percent of the moments moments in time to 35 35 .
That means that eight of 10 decisions , experiences and @@UNKNOWN@@ -- which are from your life , which is what it is , until you 're in the middle of you , is happening .
Do n't worry when you 're 40 .
This group is going to go well , I believe .
We know that the first 10 years of an @@UNKNOWN@@ have an exponential impact on how much money will make .
We know that with 30 more than half the Americans are married , or with the future partners , or a relationship .
We know that the brain is going to be the second second , and I grew up in the middle of the region , and it 's going to think of the brain , which means that what you 're
We know that the people feel the same thing as the result of a lot of times more likely to life in life , and that the @@UNKNOWN@@ of women are already high - old , and that they 're
In the case , you should be @@UNKNOWN@@ about the body and the possibility .
If we think about the future of a child , we all know that the first five years of @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ in the brain is critical .
It 's the time to live in the normal life of everyday life .
But we 're going to hear a little bit about that there 's so much more like adults -- and we 're going to go back at the time .
But the people do n't listen to the war .
The press talked about the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Now , the scientists call a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ people feel stupid for people in the streets like " @@UNKNOWN@@ " or " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
That 's true .
And as a culture , we have the @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is what I 'm going to do for the last decade .
It was important to say that big things came up with a plan and a little bit of time .
Right ?
So what happens when you put someone in the head of the head , and you say , " You get 10 years in order to make something from your life ? "
Nothing .
This person is the @@UNKNOWN@@ and the @@UNKNOWN@@ and it did n't happen anything .
And so , you know , maybe a lot of smart , interesting people in the ' way like her or as your sons and my daughters and tell me to my office and say something like that , "
Or they say , " All say , as long as I 've done it for 30 years , my career , is all good . "
But later it sounds like this , " My parents are almost over and I did n't have anything .
I had a better note , when I just finished the University . "
And after that , it sounds like this . "
All of them went around and had fun , but then with 30 music , the music suddenly came from , and everybody started to sit down .
I did n't want to be the only thing that I stayed with , and I think I met my husband , because he was in my father 's next chair . "
Where are the people in the 1970s ?
Do n't do that .
OK , that 's easy , but it does n't make a mistake , because it 's a lot .
If there was a lot of high - tech things that have been there , there 's an enormous amount of @@UNKNOWN@@ in the middle of a career , a city , and a partner , two and a half
A lot of these things are like , and the last few things just show you , and @@UNKNOWN@@ all of them in the back .
The post - @@UNKNOWN@@ - @@UNKNOWN@@ crisis crisis does n't mean to make a red red .
It means that you want to do the career that you do n't want to do .
I think that you do n't have to have this kid , you do n't want to have , or the kid ca n't give up .
So many people in the ' 80s and ' 80s and look at me , and on me and tell me about her , " What did I do ? What did I think ? "
I want to change what people do in the world and think .
This is a story that shows how it works .
It 's history .
@@UNKNOWN@@ came in my office , when she was 25 , because she was like her , she had a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
She said she 'd like to work in the art of art , or in the @@UNKNOWN@@ , but she did n't have yet decided to have it in the last year .
Because that 's cheaper , she lived with her friend , who more more than his @@UNKNOWN@@ than his @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And even though they were tough , they were never even worse .
She took a lot of times in the meeting , but then she was @@UNKNOWN@@ , and she said , " Your family , you can not choose , but your friends are already . "
One day came out very , very close to tears and tears almost almost the entire hour .
She had bought a license , and she spent the whole morning so many of them @@UNKNOWN@@ , but then she was on the empty place that after the words came . "
She was almost @@UNKNOWN@@ , when she looked at me , and she said , " Who will you be when I had a car accident ?
Who will help me when I have cancer ? "
At the moment , I had to hold myself to say I said . "
But I did n't need a lawyer who really did really care about it .
And I needed a better life , and I knew this was her chance .
I 've been talking to my first patient , a lot of @@UNKNOWN@@ , just to watch like @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ 10 years ago .
In the next few months and months ago , I gave up three words that everybody would pay , or whether it 's a woman or woman .
First of all , I told her , she would n't have any @@UNKNOWN@@ , they should be a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I mean , they should be looking for something that she would help .
It 's something that you need to be an investment investment in something which is going to be next .
I did n't know anything about my work , and I do n't know how the future of work is , but I know , it creates @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So now it 's time for this international job , this @@UNKNOWN@@ , which you 're going to try to do it .
I do n't have the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the ' 90s , but they do n't count the way that they do n't even have yet .
This is @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I said to him : @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , but let 's go .
Second , I said , the urban @@UNKNOWN@@ is @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Good friends are good to go to the airport , but after the people who are sitting together with people , the way they think they 're going to be able to tell them what they know how they think
This new thing , a new person , which is mostly from outside of your own .
New things come from @@UNKNOWN@@ . " @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , " friends of friends of friends .
It 's true : The half of the @@UNKNOWN@@ is @@UNKNOWN@@ or not .
But the other half is it , and it 's not weak , and they 've got there .
The half of the jobs have never been done . If you have the head of your neighbors neighbors , they do n't have a job job .
That 's not a way . That 's how information spread .
The last advice : @@UNKNOWN@@ believed that you could n't make the family , but the friends .
This was true for her when she grew up , but when they were going to kill their own family , if they put a partner and a own family .
I told her , the time , a new family , but now .
You 're going to think that it 's 30 percent better , when it 's 20 or 25 , and I agree with you .
But any of them with you , or you live in your life , if anyone on Facebook is no progress .
The best time to do your marriage , is before you have one of them , and that means that the same way in love love to be in your life .
Your family @@UNKNOWN@@ , and that 's aware of it , and that 's what you want to do , and not , because it works , or with someone who has @@UNKNOWN@@ the time that you 've just chosen
So what happened ?
We went up with her hand , and she found the @@UNKNOWN@@ of a @@UNKNOWN@@ , in the other state in a museum .
This was a little @@UNKNOWN@@ that she helped to get there .
This @@UNKNOWN@@ gave her the reason for her friend who she lived .
Now , five years later , it 's event - to - @@UNKNOWN@@ .
She loved a man who she was aware .
She love her new career and her new family , and she @@UNKNOWN@@ me a card , and she said , " Now , that 's the line : ' in the case you do n't do it . "
In history , it sounds like that it 's all simple , but that 's what I love with .
It 's so easy to help them .
@@UNKNOWN@@ are like @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , who are just going to go to the airport , and somewhere somewhere to the West .
It 's just going to start up with a little bit of the difference if you 're going to Alaska in Alaska or in @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's equally equally for @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ or @@UNKNOWN@@ , a good conversation , a great debate , a TED conference can have an enormous amount of life over years and even over generations .
This is an idea that would all have to be done , who knows .
It 's so easy to see what I mentioned .
I 've got the privilege of these days , like @@UNKNOWN@@ , every day , you know , the island are not the new ones , so you 're looking at it , you 're going to be able to
Do n't tell you what you do n't know , or not .
You just decide now about your life .
Thank you very much .
In the entire @@UNKNOWN@@ , it was always our goal , the distance between us and digital information , the gap between our physical world and the world on the screen where we can make our imagination .
And this distance is smaller , and it 's smaller , and now it 's a little bit of a millimeter , which is a @@UNKNOWN@@ , and computers are available for everyone .
But I asked myself how it would be when if there was no border at all .
I was like to look like this .
First , I developed this tool , which is in the digital world , so if you 're changing on the screen , it becomes the physical character .
Now , designers can make their ideas like this in 3D 3D , and we can be able to be able to create virtual organs under the screen .
So this tool became the border .
But our hands still remain outside of the screen .
How can we interact with the digital information , and using the whole material of our hands ?
In Microsoft , I met , together with my wife @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , the computer @@UNKNOWN@@ and a little room on the keyboard in a digital machine .
And again , a bit of a screen screen and @@UNKNOWN@@ to the sound of my face and face , and you can put his hands out of the keyboard , in the 3D space , and touch with the
The windows and give them a position in the actual room , and you can choose them to choose how to make a book on a roof .
And then you can walk through this book , and you 're going to see lines , and they 're going to see the lines , and all of this on the virtual grid under each other .
@@UNKNOWN@@ can make their models directly with their hands and their hands .
So in these two examples , we 're in the digital world .
But how would we do it all the time and start using digital digital data ?
Sure , many of you already have the experience that I 've been doing online , and I 'm going to go online .
But now you have to worry about it .
Here I have a @@UNKNOWN@@ online @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This is what you get through a head of your head or your head if the system is the geometry of our body .
So this idea , I started thinking about the @@UNKNOWN@@ , not only in the room , but they 're able to do it , so that we can touch it , and you can feel it .
How would look like this future ?
And at the MIT Lab , I 've been working together with my dad @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and my colleague @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Now , in this case , it 's going to be able to make these @@UNKNOWN@@ , like a three - dimensional @@UNKNOWN@@ in our world , and that means that both computers and the same thing as long as
We 've changed the gravity gravity , and control the movement , by using magnetic @@UNKNOWN@@ , mechanical mechanical and these @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In order to create this object , we open it from the limitations through space and time , so that the human mind is now , @@UNKNOWN@@ and more in the real world .
So , as long as long as long - term , you can learn from art , or Michael @@UNKNOWN@@ , " @@UNKNOWN@@ " and again in the real world .
For example , these can use use to use complex concepts like @@UNKNOWN@@ and physics , and differently than in @@UNKNOWN@@ or @@UNKNOWN@@ , this is a real and physical experience that you can touch and touch , and it
And yet , more than just what we 're right now in the computer , we have it to imagine how the memory of the world is actually changing our activity .
How can you be able to get digital information that we do n't just show you , but we 're starting to start directly with our brains , as part of our physical environment , without ourselves ourselves from our
Today , we started talking about the limits , but when we 're the border , the only border our imagination .
Thank you very much .
I 've been working for two years to be a @@UNKNOWN@@ , in @@UNKNOWN@@ , China , in the 1970s .
When I was in the first grade , I wanted to say the government on a school for @@UNKNOWN@@ , all @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But my mother said , " No . "
My parents wanted me to be an engineer .
After they created the Industrial Revolution , they believed that it was the only way to happiness , and good job job .
It 's not important if I like the job or not .
But my dream was to be a Chinese @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I 'm like I play on my piano piano .
Now , an idea has to be very early with the training training training , so I tried to walk in the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I wrote even at the @@UNKNOWN@@ and the @@UNKNOWN@@ of a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But the adults do n't like my idea .
The adults did n't think it was seriously seriously .
Just my friends , including me , but they were also children as well as I myself .
And with 15 years ago , I knew that I was too old to start with training training .
So my dream would never be true .
I was afraid I was going to help the rest of my life just a happy second .
But that 's so bad .
So I sat down on the head , another person .
No one way to teach me a little bit .
So I turned up books .
I 'm going to take my bed for @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ with this book about a @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
[ " @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ " [ " ] of the history of history of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in 2011 , I started in the United States , and what do I read first ?
Of course books , China in China .
" The good Earth " is about life from the Chinese farmers .
It 's just not just like propaganda .
The Bible is interesting , but weird .
But this is a subject for another time .
But the fifth @@UNKNOWN@@ took me a kind of an @@UNKNOWN@@ , " You would invite your father and your mother . "
" @@UNKNOWN@@ , " I thought , " That 's so different and much better than @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
That was my way in order to get me from the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and the relationship to my parents .
In the face with a new culture , I started with reading @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This is a lot of courage .
So , I found this first first thing to first first , because the Chinese student grew up with this one .
It never made me in the sense of China China not at the center of the world .
So a map says something about the personal view .
The science does n't read anything new .
In the academic world , it 's a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
There are even more @@UNKNOWN@@ like @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And I 'm going to argue with a different understanding of a subject .
So I thought , when @@UNKNOWN@@ read in science research , why do n't do it in every day ?
So I began to read two books at the same time .
They can be done by people -- and that , " Benjamin @@UNKNOWN@@ " by @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , " @@UNKNOWN@@ of David @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ at the same event , or with friends .
[ " We @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
In @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ economic economic , political and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In the fact , they were all psychological psychological : @@UNKNOWN@@ , fear and social .
If you have a language language , it 's also fun to read the @@UNKNOWN@@ in two languages .
[ " @@UNKNOWN@@ for a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of Thomas @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
In translation , I 've been able to realize that " happiness " in the words , " @@UNKNOWN@@ " " joy . "
" @@UNKNOWN@@ , " in the language , " @@UNKNOWN@@ " " A mother . "
For example , for me like a magic , I have a connection to the people and the present .
I know that I 'm never going to feel more than my own or feeling .
A @@UNKNOWN@@ dream is really not a factor of what a lot of others have gone through .
I came to believe that it 's not the only goal of a @@UNKNOWN@@ to be true .
His goal for it is to connect with us in touch with where our dreams come and our happiness .
Even a @@UNKNOWN@@ dream can make this purpose .
In other books , I 'm here , happy , again with a purpose in life and with @@UNKNOWN@@ , most of the time .
@@UNKNOWN@@ books have to be .
Thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
When I was eight years old , a new girl in the class , and she was so amazing , like new girls are still too .
She had a lot of hair hair and a little bit of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and it was good in @@UNKNOWN@@ and in @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In this year , I came up with @@UNKNOWN@@ , until I had a @@UNKNOWN@@ plan .
So I had a day a lot longer in school , a lot longer , and kept me in the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
When the air was , I came up , and I took myself in the classroom , and I took the @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And then I did .
I do the notes of my @@UNKNOWN@@ , just a few things .
All right .
When I wanted to read the book , I realized that some of my others were quite pretty good notes .
So I 'm in the @@UNKNOWN@@ of all the notes , absolutely no imagination .
I gave all of my own and my own myself , because I was also the whole time .
I 'm still @@UNKNOWN@@ about my behavior .
I do n't understand where the idea came .
I do n't understand why I feel so good .
I felt really good .
I do n't understand why I never got it .
It was so obvious .
I never got caught .
But most of me , why did n't it so much that this little girl was so good at the @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
@@UNKNOWN@@ me .
It 's so familiar , so deep .
We know that babies are suffering under @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Anyway , like @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We know that the most of the most important reason for HIV is in the United States .
But I 've never read a study that I learned to her , and she had to find their @@UNKNOWN@@ or their @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Now , we need to go to the literature , because the novel is the laboratory , in the middle of all sorts of different shapes .
Is it an economist to say that if we did n't have an @@UNKNOWN@@ , we could have no literature ?
So no @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , no " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
No @@UNKNOWN@@ King King , no " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
No @@UNKNOWN@@ .
There 's the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the U.S. schools , because we lose , " sound and @@UNKNOWN@@ , " the Great " @@UNKNOWN@@ " " " @@UNKNOWN@@ , " @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
I did n't argue , I said , well , I know that it has made in the world , saying that the answer has the answer to everything , but in terms of @@UNKNOWN@@ , he has really really
This year , we celebrate the 200 . @@UNKNOWN@@ of his @@UNKNOWN@@ " on the search after the lost time , " and the @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and the normal @@UNKNOWN@@ , my thing that we can hope
Let 's think about politicians , think about feelings . Right ?
We think about the little boy that 's trying to sleep .
We think about a piece of chocolate , in @@UNKNOWN@@ tea .
We forget how hard his vision was .
We forget about @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
These kinds of books have been built by Virginia @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I do n't know how @@UNKNOWN@@ is , but we 're saying .
Let 's look at why and the novel and the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ so well .
Is it so obvious that , in the case , in terms of @@UNKNOWN@@ -- -- -- -- that -- is that it 's such a critical basis for a story ?
I do n't know . I think it 's just hard to think of it , because you think of what happens when we are @@UNKNOWN@@ .
If we 're @@UNKNOWN@@ , we tell a story .
We tell ourselves stories about the lives of other people , and they 're doing bad it because it 's so good that it makes us bad .
When the history of history and the audience , we need to see the details that they have to have to make the knife into the hill .
In fact , it makes us all of these @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and it seems to be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In the first band , " in @@UNKNOWN@@ world , in the novel number , @@UNKNOWN@@ , one of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ very much about his love and how great she is in bed , and suddenly , in
Everything that gives me to me , and what makes joy joy , maybe someone can feel joy , maybe even in that moment . "
This is the story that he told us , and it 's written at @@UNKNOWN@@ , that @@UNKNOWN@@ every new @@UNKNOWN@@ , which he discovered at his @@UNKNOWN@@ , to his @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in his private @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We need to say that the @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ are @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ friends would have to leave the country if they had to end with him .
But you do n't have to get rid of it , is that it 's hard work , right ?
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's a @@UNKNOWN@@ feeling that 's going to be .
What does that mean ?
@@UNKNOWN@@ like this .
@@UNKNOWN@@ like the details .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , long , hair hair and little cute @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ like photographs .
That 's why it 's so successful .
It basically @@UNKNOWN@@ the language of science and the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
If you look at this @@UNKNOWN@@ , suddenly , at the door , and the @@UNKNOWN@@ of his loved @@UNKNOWN@@ , he @@UNKNOWN@@ this behavior .
He says , " You may think that it 's terrible , but it 's also a different thing to read a text text or a look at it . "
He says , " There 's scientific research with @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
In fact , we 're going to show us that the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and we do n't look like it , but in its core , it 's a search for knowledge , to the truth , the most
@@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , loss -- that 's for the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He says , " A woman who we need , the way we feel , @@UNKNOWN@@ us a bigger and the spectrum of feelings as the genius of a man who 's interested in . "
Let 's tell us about that we 're going to worry about women ?
No . I think he 's going to tell us that we 're going to tell us something about ourselves .
Is there a different feeling that we opened up with this particular way ?
@@UNKNOWN@@ any other feeling of us , our beauty , and I 'm going to fight ?
@@UNKNOWN@@ us out of any other way to feel like that .
@@UNKNOWN@@ should be writing about this .
One day was discovered by a very young young man who was thinking about the idea of his mind .
And @@UNKNOWN@@ says , this guy is kind of weird , because he does n't even see what his wife does .
Because she 's an person , and everybody knows that .
The poor creature is @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Instead , he looked at things that his wife without without it , but the behavior behavior .
@@UNKNOWN@@ them too much , or she 's going to do with a guy ?
[ @@UNKNOWN@@ ] says that the guy on the @@UNKNOWN@@ for the @@UNKNOWN@@ of his wife .
The novel is very good at this point .
The novel described very well , like @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , but not exactly the same .
Because the @@UNKNOWN@@ we are , the more we put it into us .
So I think that democracy does n't lead to us , @@UNKNOWN@@ or illegal things .
In fact , that causes us to become very @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And I think about eight years ago , but I also think the story I 've heard in the news .
A @@UNKNOWN@@ woman from @@UNKNOWN@@ , because she was made by a self - @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ -- a year - old , @@UNKNOWN@@ news on his own .
A whole year .
She was trying to make the new friend of her friend friend in the shoes in the shoes , and I 'll give them when I heard that , but I was with it .
Because ... let 's be honest .
How incredible , even more @@UNKNOWN@@ , creativity .
This is something from a novel .
This is something from a novel of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ is one of my @@UNKNOWN@@ .
She 's the @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ woman 's American literature .
From her , " Two stranger in the train , " and " The @@UNKNOWN@@ Mr. @@UNKNOWN@@ , " all of the things that we talk about , like @@UNKNOWN@@ -- they feel our minds , and we 're in
So , Tom Tom , her most famous character .
First of Tom , you have to be Tom , and you have what you 've got , and you have what you 've once once , and you 're like the ground .
This is a way .
But what are we going to do ? We ca n't do it with Tom @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I ca n't have all the world of the world , even if I 'd like to do it for some days .
It 's a shame , because we live in a @@UNKNOWN@@ period .
We live in a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We 're all good citizens of social media , which is the currency ?
@@UNKNOWN@@ us from the novel ? I 'm not sure .
Now , what we do is , what do they do when they 're not sure when they 're in the part of a show .
So let 's go to @@UNKNOWN@@ Street , and I 'm going to ask myself .
Think about people who are thinking about their @@UNKNOWN@@ as a professor , @@UNKNOWN@@ genius , this genius genius .
But I always liked the [ unclear ] @@UNKNOWN@@ , the head of @@UNKNOWN@@ 's face with the face of a rat , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the genius genius , but it 's @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That 's me so familiar .
So it needs to help his help , and it @@UNKNOWN@@ him and @@UNKNOWN@@ in the same stories .
But when they work together , it starts to change something , and eventually finally , " The six @@UNKNOWN@@ " as a @@UNKNOWN@@ , and all of the solution , it seems to be @@UNKNOWN@@ and say , "
We 're proud of you . "
And he also does n't put it down at the top of the @@UNKNOWN@@ that would not be able to follow the hand .
That 's one of the few times that we 're going to see in our stories , and I think this little bit very , very similar , but also a little bit familiar . Right ?
It seems to be as an emotional response , but a physical problem .
In a moment , there 's a bit of a different range of how @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And in the next moment , they 're on a distance .
Suddenly it brings up to this genius , this genius that he gave him him before .
Is it really easy ?
What if it really was a real problem ? If it was just going to be the way we deal with the other in relationship ? "
Maybe we would n't give someone someone 's @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We could put it together .
But I like @@UNKNOWN@@ .
While we 're waiting , we still have the literature as a literature .
@@UNKNOWN@@ alone @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ alone can @@UNKNOWN@@ them .
And one of the things : the good @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ Tom , the crazy @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We 're in society .
Thank you very much .
I was about 10 years old and on a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ with my father in @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , a @@UNKNOWN@@ in the northern part of the New York .
It was a beautiful day .
The forest @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The sun would leaves the leaves like the glass of glass glass , and if there was n't going to be able to be able to almost almost that we would be the first people to go through these forests
We came to our @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I looked at this little stage on a rock , and I looked over a @@UNKNOWN@@ , beautiful lake , when I was something bad .
@@UNKNOWN@@ the roof was a @@UNKNOWN@@ , maybe four square meter , with apple @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and a old @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I was surprised , and I was angry .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ were too @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , which they had -- they did , who they thought , would they say ?
The question was , and I @@UNKNOWN@@ them .
Who @@UNKNOWN@@ us ?
How do you think about it , and what do we like to say , who are behind us in the middle ?
Who is behind us in Rio ? Or in Paris or in London ?
Here , in New York , the @@UNKNOWN@@ of every day , about a thousand tons of plastic and @@UNKNOWN@@ tons of tons of water .
I wanted to ask them -- as individuals .
I wanted to understand what the job does .
How is it going to stand up with these pressure and ?
So I started a research project .
I went up with the trucks , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I met people in office and buildings in the entire city . I learned a lot , but I was still a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I had to go deeper .
So I took a job as a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I did n't drive up with the @@UNKNOWN@@ . I went to the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And I 'm going to make the mechanical mechanical and @@UNKNOWN@@ the snow .
It was an extraordinary privilege and an exciting experience .
Everyone says to the smell .
He 's there , but not so much , as you think , and at the days , it 's really bad , you 're very quickly at it .
On the weight , it 's hard .
I know people who do this job for several years , their body still @@UNKNOWN@@ the weight that they need to their bodies , full of water every week .
Then there 's the danger .
After the statistics of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the job in the middle of the top of the most dangerous parts in the country , and I learned why .
You 're all over the streets , all over the world .
All of the people end up and often do n't stop the same car .
It 's really bad for the workers .
And the waste itself is full of @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I learned how the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
If you look from the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and from the back of the back of the city of the city of a city , you can see that waste like a @@UNKNOWN@@ itself .
He does n't stop thinking .
He 's also like a way of breathing or air .
He needs to be moving .
And then there 's the stigma .
You 're going to get rid of it , and it 's invisible , until someone -- from the reason , and it 's crazy , because you 're going to keep the streets with the car , or a
I think of that stigma , especially because I believe that the staff of the most important part in the streets of the city . This has three reasons .
They 're the @@UNKNOWN@@ of public health .
If they did n't get rid of the waste , every day , and it was effective , and it was produced by the @@UNKNOWN@@ and the @@UNKNOWN@@ that we would have to protect us in very low ways .
@@UNKNOWN@@ that we 've been done for decades and centuries of control , and spread out .
The economy needs it .
If we do n't take the old stuff away , we do n't have a place for the new store , the engine of the economy , when it 's @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I do n't have traditional capitalism , and I do n't just smart them .
And then that 's what I 'm going to do with the average , the way that we 're trying to do .
I mean , just quickly , how fast we 're working on movement today .
We do n't care about our @@UNKNOWN@@ , our pocket or our drink , or our water to @@UNKNOWN@@ , or @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We take it away , they 're missing , but we know that there are people on the other side , which is why .
So I want to give you some ways of how to think about how we think about how to think about the stigma and make it into this conversation , like you can create a city , which is sustainable
Their work , I think , is somehow @@UNKNOWN@@ .
You see the streets every day .
They wear in lots of cities .
You know if you can expect it .
And they work with our work .
They 're like a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The process that it does , it makes us sure that we 're going to give us ourselves from our @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ and the process , and it 's going to be able to be able to pay
In the days of September 11 , I heard the @@UNKNOWN@@ of a @@UNKNOWN@@ on the street , my little son , and my @@UNKNOWN@@ broke down , and there was a man who had his paper .
And I tried to take him for his work -- this day of all day , but I started crying .
And he looked at me , and she just said , " Everything 's going to be good . "
" Everything gets good . "
Just later , I started doing my research over the world , and I met the guy .
His name is @@UNKNOWN@@ , and we worked together together , eventually we got good friends .
I wanted to believe that @@UNKNOWN@@ was right .
Everything is fine .
But in our effort that we have to change the way we think about this planet as a species that we need to use all of the costs , including the human cost of work .
And we 've got to be able to get people to do this work , their experience , how we think about how we can create systems like the technologies that we can solve from wars -- which is a
@@UNKNOWN@@ waste that we think when we talk about waste , which is three percent of the national @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's a remarkable statistics .
In your life , in the process of your life , if you look at the next time , it 's going to leave you with it , you 'll just take a moment .
Take a moment to thank you .
Hi , what 's ?
It 's not enough .
Hi , what 's ?
My name is @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I 'm not sorry , but the doctor at my birth .
He took my mother six months in six different ways of @@UNKNOWN@@ and poor people to make the air .
So I have @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , which means that I have the whole time .
Look .
It 's hard . I 'm a @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ is not genetic .
It 's not a voice . You ca n't get them .
None of the one of my mother 's mother , and I do n't have it , because my parents are my parents , first , are my parents .
You just get through six times , like the first day of my birth .
I have to tell you . I 'm not a source of the inspiration , and I do n't want to anyone that anyone who makes you feel sorry , because all of you have a point in your life
Come on .
It 's just a long - year - year - old year , and it 's circles on the search for a space , and what do you see ?
@@UNKNOWN@@ empty @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And you think , " Why ca n't I be a little bit of emotional ? "
I have to tell you , I 've got 99 problems , and it 's just one of them .
If there were a @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ , I got a gold gold .
I 'm @@UNKNOWN@@ , Muslim , women , and I live in New Zealand .
If you do n't feel better , I do n't know .
@@UNKNOWN@@ Park in New Zealand is my home .
I love the fact that my @@UNKNOWN@@ and I live the same ones .
I love the fact that I wanted to go from my house to New York City when I wanted to .
Many people did n't walk , but my parents did n't think they could n't believe in "
The trick of my dad was , " Yes , you can do that ! You can . "
So if I do my three older sister , I feel with .
When my three older sisters were going to a public school , @@UNKNOWN@@ my parents , the way I could do it , and if we did n't all of our @@UNKNOWN@@ , we all @@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ of my
My dad took me to work when I was five years by using my @@UNKNOWN@@ on his feet , and just @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Another one of his @@UNKNOWN@@ was a @@UNKNOWN@@ of my nose .
My internal @@UNKNOWN@@ was very strong , and when -- yes . So , the first day in a kindergarten , I was like a @@UNKNOWN@@ who had a lot of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
At the time , it was six six days in my city and all of my family .
Today we have 20 years in the city , and they 're still all my family .
I think nobody has ever noticed that we do n't have an Italian .
This was 11 years ago , and before politicians would stop it , " I hate Muslims as " @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
The people I grew up with no problem with my faith .
But they were also worried that I could be able to go back to birds .
And I told them that I was living by my body three three months months , so I was going to get out of my @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I have @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Yeah , @@UNKNOWN@@ de @@UNKNOWN@@ .
My parents could n't afford a @@UNKNOWN@@ , so they sent me to me .
And I learned how to teach you in my way , so I can walk on a walk .
And I 'm from @@UNKNOWN@@ , where it 's really important to be @@UNKNOWN@@ , so if my friends were wearing , I would also .
And when my friends go back to the coast of California , I did n't .
I spent my summer in a @@UNKNOWN@@ , because my parents were afraid that we were n't going to go home every day that we 're going to go back to Iran , one day .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ that I was going to help me that my dad would help me , so I had to get milk from @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , which was going to be in the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I
But there was a @@UNKNOWN@@ , we found .
I have to say , it 's really boring , but before I was doing it , I was going to stand up at the point , I could n't even leave you .
Now I can go on the head .
My parents @@UNKNOWN@@ me , and that I would be able to be able to think that no dream was impossible , and my dream , it was , at the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And I 've done a lot of the reasons that I 've been doing with a great psychologist at the University of the State State University University , because I have any certain @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I was the @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Everybody loved me .
I do all of the homework that I did n't have so smart kids , and I 've got all of my @@UNKNOWN@@ classes in all of their classes .
Every time I wrote a scene from " The @@UNKNOWN@@ , " @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But I never got a role .
In my @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ finally came up with a piece of @@UNKNOWN@@ , which he said , " You dance in @@UNKNOWN@@ .
A piece of a girl with high .
I was a girl .
So I @@UNKNOWN@@ everywhere . "
I have @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Finally , finally .
Thank God , I 'm finally @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
I did n't matter .
@@UNKNOWN@@ Brown got the role .
I wrote to the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , I was crying , and when someone asked my cat , and asked her why . She told me that she did n't kill the same thing .
I said , " Sorry , but if I do n't do the same thing , I ca n't do the same thing , but I do n't have the character . "
I was born for this role , and they gave them an open without @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I learned to college .
Hollywood is @@UNKNOWN@@ - known to be able to play healthy .
After that , I started back home with my first role as a @@UNKNOWN@@ in a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
My dream was true .
And I knew that I was going to come back to " @@UNKNOWN@@ " " Good @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
But instead , I was going to do a lot of it , which was just at the back of the back , and I realized that there was no @@UNKNOWN@@ -- no " @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , an
They were just perfect .
But there are the rule .
I grew up with @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and all these women had a common : They were @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So I became @@UNKNOWN@@ .
My first job was to do famous famous from New York City to show in New York , and I 'm never going to leave the face of the first @@UNKNOWN@@ that I ever ever , and when he was
I 'm in Cambridge everywhere in the United States , so I also have shown in the Middle East , and I @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Some people say I 'm the first world in the Arab world .
I do n't like to be the first , but I do n't know that they 're never heard of the bad little bit of things that are women who are not funny , and they find ourselves .
In 2003 , my brother came from one another mother and father , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I was with the New York @@UNKNOWN@@ American @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is now @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Our goal was to think about the negative image of Americans , in the media , in media media , and at the end of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , we do n't remember that South Asia , and we 're not
The @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ was much , much more than the challenge , against the stigma of the stigma .
My big breakthrough .
I was going to be asked as a @@UNKNOWN@@ in the @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I came up with the @@UNKNOWN@@ , she took me into a studio and put me on a chair chair .
So I looked at the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I said , " Sorry , can I get some other chair ? "
And she looked at me and said , " Five , four , three , two ... "
And we were live .
So I had to sit at the table at the table of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , so I sat in the front of the screen , and when the interview was , I was except .
And I had my chance , and I had it , and I knew that the @@UNKNOWN@@ never @@UNKNOWN@@ me .
But Mr. @@UNKNOWN@@ did n't just put it back , but it took me to a full - year - @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
At the work with Keith , I learned something that I 've learned about something that people are on the Internet .
People say , children are terrible , but as a kid or adults , or never , someone has been funny to me .
In the World Web Web , I came up with my heart suddenly .
If I look at online videos , I see the comments like this , " Why , why do n't you like that ? "
" Hey , is the crazy ? "
And my favorite , " @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Did they have a disease ?
We should pray .
One of them even when I believe in the @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's such a way that we can see how the result .
If you do n't have a guy who ca n't play @@UNKNOWN@@ , he ca n't play a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ are the largest -- yes . This is an apple .
People with our challenges are the largest south of the world and we 're the @@UNKNOWN@@ in the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The doctors said I could never walk , but I 'm sitting here today .
But I grew up with social media I would n't be here .
I hope that we 're going to create together a @@UNKNOWN@@ image of @@UNKNOWN@@ in the media and in the future .
Maybe there would be less @@UNKNOWN@@ in the Internet when there are more positive models .
Or maybe not .
Maybe it 's still a village to make a kid 's good .
My journey with me took a few very special places .
I have been able to sit on the red red next next - star star , and the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I was able to play in a film with Adam @@UNKNOWN@@ , and with my friend , the wonderful @@UNKNOWN@@ , wonderful .
I 'm as a @@UNKNOWN@@ with the Institute of " @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ " to the world .
I was @@UNKNOWN@@ the great @@UNKNOWN@@ of New Zealand in the National @@UNKNOWN@@ in 2008 .
I 've called " @@UNKNOWN@@ 's children , a @@UNKNOWN@@ , who 's trying to protect the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ of a chance to give my parents .
But the one moment , most of the @@UNKNOWN@@ -- before this -- -- the moment , most of the most @@UNKNOWN@@ , when I was looking for the guy , like a car flies , and how a bee
That was the only time that my dad would ever have a live dream of me , and I 'd like to talk about this talk .
BG : God God your soul , and my dad is my dad . My name is @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , " if I can , you can do it . "
There was a time where we were big problems .
At the top of July , June @@UNKNOWN@@ , they came out of the @@UNKNOWN@@ and 17 feet down on the sea .
@@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ were alone , but their eyes were at the size of the size of the size of a @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The Apollo program was the largest @@UNKNOWN@@ in the history of the United States of America .
In order to go to the moon , NASA took about four billion dollars on the last value , or four percent of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ took jobs for mothers and people working together with 20,000 companies and universities .
People were dying , including the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the last one .
But until the end of the crash -- it flew 24 people on the moon .
From the 12 , the surface of the surface , is @@UNKNOWN@@ , after death death last year , now the oldest .
But why did they go ?
They did n't buy a lot of time : @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and something that every week later -- a new sense of the time that our shared home is small and fragile .
Why did they go ? @@UNKNOWN@@ , they said , President president , who wanted to be the president who wanted to show that his nation had better better .
But even their own words , of course , at the University University University have a better evidence .
For example , it was n't a @@UNKNOWN@@ of the West across the East during the Cold War .
And at that time , the most powerful feeling of a sense of @@UNKNOWN@@ about the power forces of technology .
They flew on the moon , because it was something amazing .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ happened in one of a long series of technological technologies .
For the first half of the 20th century , the @@UNKNOWN@@ and the airplane , @@UNKNOWN@@ and a vaccine against @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In the middle of the century , polio and smallpox smallpox .
Now , it seemed to be something that was @@UNKNOWN@@ in terms of what started @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
For the most of the human history , we could n't go back faster than a horse or a boat with @@UNKNOWN@@ , but in the year , the world would be the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the 10 pounds of a
In 2007 , not human beings were more on the moon .
No one has never been able to grow faster than the speed of the Apollo 10 , and the optimism optimism about the power of technology .
I remember that I 'm like @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It took the picture of the 17 17 and my mother , which was not a very @@UNKNOWN@@ in the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of Saturn @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I had an idea that this would be the last @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , but I was sure I was going to be able to live in my life back to Mars .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ " something happened with our ability to have big problems with technology , because it became a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
You hear it everywhere .
We heard this in the last two days in TED .
It 's going to be done with us , and if we have been proud , and self - connected with the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , with things like @@UNKNOWN@@ and artificial and social media , or algorithms , the magic
It 's not wrong with most of these things .
They have our lives and lives .
But they do n't solve the big problems of humanity .
What happened ?
There 's a @@UNKNOWN@@ explanation of the Silicon Valley , where you 're going to be @@UNKNOWN@@ in the last few times more successful companies than in the years ago at Microsoft , Microsoft and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In Silicon Valley , you 'll say that the markets would be that , in particular , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ companies .
In Silicon Valley , they 're going to move away from the world , changing - changing ideas , and they 're going to solve problems or even more complex problems .
But this explanation is not good enough .
It 's mostly what happens to Silicon Valley .
Even to their @@UNKNOWN@@ times , the small amount of @@UNKNOWN@@ were able to be able to grow small amounts of investment in a @@UNKNOWN@@ within 10 years .
Now , investors have always been able to go out in technologies like energy , which is an enormous @@UNKNOWN@@ and economic development , and development development , and they never never had the development of technologies , the big
No , the reasons why we ca n't solve a big problem , we 're complicated and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Sometimes we do n't recognize the big problems .
We could fly to Mars .
NASA has created a plan .
But to Mars , this would be a political choice of public @@UNKNOWN@@ , and it will never happen .
We 're not going to fly on Mars , because everybody thinks that there 's on the Earth 's important things that have to be done .
Another time we ca n't solve the big problems , because our political systems fail .
Today , less than two percent of the energy of the energy of the global economy , energy sources , like solar , wind and wind , less than two percent , and the reason for it is sustainable economic
coal and natural resources are cheaper than solar and wind and oil is cheaper than cheaper .
We do n't want any more energy source , the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , but it does n't exist .
Now , it 's so that the biologists , @@UNKNOWN@@ and economists , at the end of all of the same opinion of what we can do is , national national and international international development would be able to make
But in the political political climate , there 's no hope that the power of the United States or the international international @@UNKNOWN@@ these ideas and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Sometimes there are deep problems that are actually @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It was a long - term that the failure of failure is going to help you .
But 30 years ago , we have taught us that the political crisis are going to have climate change that have impact impact on the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We can do things like @@UNKNOWN@@ or systems like @@UNKNOWN@@ and health systems of food , but it 's going to be able to get people everywhere .
In the end of the problems , the problems do n't solve the solutions , because we do n't understand the problem .
President @@UNKNOWN@@ described the cancer of the war , but you found out that there are lots of species of cancer , which is most likely to be @@UNKNOWN@@ against treatment , and only on the last 10 years ,
@@UNKNOWN@@ problems are difficult .
It 's not true that we ca n't solve problems with technology .
We can have to deal with it , but we need to get these four elements of all the challenges : @@UNKNOWN@@ politicians and the public needs to be interested in order to solve a problem , we need to
The @@UNKNOWN@@ , the way of a metaphor metaphor for the ability to solve the technology , the problems , to solve these @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But this is a model that what happens in the future .
It 's not the year .
There 's no dramatic fight fight like the Cold War , no politicians like John John , the most difficult and dangerous thing to a @@UNKNOWN@@ , and not a popular science fiction fiction like the research system .
But most importantly , it was at the end to fly the moon .
He was just three days .
And it 's @@UNKNOWN@@ whether it really has a serious problem .
We 're on ourselves , and the solutions of the future will be more difficult .
I mean God , it 's not all the challenges .
Thank you very much .
I want to invite your eyes .
Think of you , you 're going on your front .
@@UNKNOWN@@ the door , her color and the material out of it .
Now you 're going to give you a group of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ on their cars .
It 's a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and they come up to you and your mouth .
You have to really imagine this .
They @@UNKNOWN@@ down , @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ right now .
And then they put all right into your door .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , all over the car , and across the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Now , over the threshold of your apartment in your @@UNKNOWN@@ , your @@UNKNOWN@@ or whatever you are on the other side of your @@UNKNOWN@@ , and you feel like the light in the room .
The light seems to @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It makes you look at the back of a yellow yellow @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ a horse .
You can feel better than his friends are your nose .
You @@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ that it @@UNKNOWN@@ into your mouth .
Go back to him over in your living room .
You 're going to share with you all the power of your imagination .
Their clothes just @@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and she 's called " @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , " and she @@UNKNOWN@@ on your @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Now I 'm in your kitchen .
The soil was made by a yellow @@UNKNOWN@@ , and from your iPhone , you know , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ and the @@UNKNOWN@@ from " The magician of @@UNKNOWN@@ , " she 's going to
Okay . Now open your eyes .
I want to tell you a very unusual competition , every year in the spring in New York City .
He 's called " United States @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
A few years ago , I wanted to play from this competition as a @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I would expect the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It was a bunch of guys and some of them , ladies and very high - old .
They 're looking at @@UNKNOWN@@ times hundreds of random numbers .
@@UNKNOWN@@ the name of @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And they kept all poetry in a few minutes .
It 's about who you can make the order of a @@UNKNOWN@@ that was going to be able to do faster .
That 's crazy .
These people have to have abilities .
I started talking with some of them .
This is Rio , a guy who came from England , and there 's one of the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And I asked him , " Hey , when do you notice that you have that special ?
And I said , " I 'm not a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I just have an average memory .
Every one of them here , you 'll tell you that he or she only has a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We 've all taught us to do the process of modern techniques that are trained to create these incredible @@UNKNOWN@@ of techniques . The techniques that the Greeks had two million years ago , the same thing that used to
And I just thought , " Wow , how do I have never heard about it ? "
We were out outside of the @@UNKNOWN@@ and Rio , this wonderful , brilliant , brilliant , and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , he says , " Josh , you 're an American journalist .
You know @@UNKNOWN@@ ? "
I said , " What ? @@UNKNOWN@@ . Why ? "
" I 'd like to buy @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , like , you know , you can make the order of a @@UNKNOWN@@ that 's learning .
It would be able to prove it all the way . "
I told him , " I 'm not @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , but you could teach it .
I mean , you have to start somewhere somewhere , right ? "
And this was a very slow journey for me .
A lot of the next year I did n't just try to study my memory , but also to study it , and to understand how it works , why it sometimes does n't work , and it might be
I met a lot of interesting people .
This is for example .
He 's suffering from suffering , and probably probably the worst mind of the world .
His memory is so bad that he does n't even remember what it is .
Even though it was so tragic , he won the idea of how much our memory is what we do .
On the other side of the spectrum I learned .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He was the @@UNKNOWN@@ for @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in the movie " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
We spent a afternoon , in the public library in New York City City school called New York City .
And I came back to read a whole lot of all of the memory of the memory , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , two years ago , and more in the @@UNKNOWN@@ in New York , and in the Middle Europe ,
And I learned a whole lot of interesting things .
In fact , I was fascinated me that there was a time to go to the idea of the memory to train memory , too @@UNKNOWN@@ , not close to @@UNKNOWN@@ as today .
There was a time to keep people in their memory , it @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Over the last few years , we invented a series of technologies -- from the @@UNKNOWN@@ to @@UNKNOWN@@ , for the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the computer , the computer , the smartphone -- that it has always made
These technologies have created our modern world , but we 're also changing .
They changed us , and I would argue that they have changed them .
Without the need to remember , it seems sometimes when we forget about how it goes .
One of the last places of this Earth , where you can find people who can still be more passionate about their memory , and @@UNKNOWN@@ , and that is a unique memory of competition .
In fact , it 's not so unique , there are @@UNKNOWN@@ like this all over the world .
And that 's what I 'm going to do with the magic I wanted to know how people do that .
A few years ago , a group of the University of college started a group of @@UNKNOWN@@ in the lab .
They wanted to know this : Is the structure or intelligence of their brains differently than the rest of us ?
The answer was no .
Are you smarter than we ?
They gave them a @@UNKNOWN@@ and the answer was not .
But there was an interesting and more important difference between the brain of a brain and the control , which was compared to it .
If you put them into a brain machine , and your brain , you can see numbers , faces and images of @@UNKNOWN@@ , you can see that you can see that in the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the other parts of
It seems like they 're going to use the part of their memory , which is to remember the @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Why ? And can we learn something else ?
The competition to make the best memory is going to be from a kind of race race in every every year with a new technology for @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of more facts and the rest of the hole .
This is my friend Ben @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
On the table , he did n't drink him at the top of him when it was within an hour with a technology that he invented and as @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He used a similar technology to be able to measure the exact order of four inches in a @@UNKNOWN@@ hour .
Yeah .
And although there 's a lot of the techniques that have been different things in these @@UNKNOWN@@ , but all of these techniques are based on the concept , the psychologist , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So this is called @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is this concept of @@UNKNOWN@@ , and it 's like that , if I want two people to be able to hear the same word , and I say , " You
That 's his name .
And you tell me , " @@UNKNOWN@@ you that there 's a person who is a @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
Now , if I 'm going to go back to you , and I 'll say , " You know , the word I told you about a few years ago ?
Do you know what he was ? "
The person who seems to recognize the person , named @@UNKNOWN@@ , is that it seems to be more likely to the word as the person that person to listen to the person .
Same word , @@UNKNOWN@@ memory ; that 's weird .
What 's going on here ?
Well , the name does n't mean anything .
He 's completely independent of all of the @@UNKNOWN@@ that you have in your head .
But the job of the world , we know .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , funny white @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ have made their hands .
@@UNKNOWN@@ smell , if they come from the work home .
Maybe we even know a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And when we hear the word first , we 're going to make these things with the word , and then it @@UNKNOWN@@ the word later later .
The secret is what happens in the memory of the way , and the secret to look at all kinds of different things that can be able to find a way to find the name of the @@UNKNOWN@@ in the
One of the most complex techniques that we can do two million years back to the ancient Greeks .
It was known as the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The story of his creation is like this : There was a poet called the @@UNKNOWN@@ , who was a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He was involved in the conversation , because when you really got a really big party , it would n't be a @@UNKNOWN@@ , but a poet .
He 's wearing his poem from the memory , and it leaves the room . In the moment , the @@UNKNOWN@@ behind it , and @@UNKNOWN@@ all @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Not only are dead , their bodies are @@UNKNOWN@@ to @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Nobody can tell you who who was there , nobody knows who has been .
The body ca n't be right .
It 's a tragedy .
It 's out that the only day of that disaster . He @@UNKNOWN@@ his eyes , and suddenly suddenly he can see that his brain eye can see what 's going on .
And it takes the @@UNKNOWN@@ in the hand , and it leads through the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In this moment , I realized a little bit of what we all know that we all have already realized that we do n't matter how bad we do , but we do n't have to name the data ,
If I ask you to ask the first 10 words of history of history , you would never find it .
But I bet if I 'd ask you to remember who is at the moment of a yellow yellow @@UNKNOWN@@ in your pocket , you 're going to be able to do it .
The idea of @@UNKNOWN@@ is it to create a building in your eye , and it 's with images of images to the stuff -- the crazy , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , so it 's
This is a advice that goes over and over 1,000 years old talking about the memory .
So how does it work ?
If you 're invited to be here at TED , and you want to take him out of the memory , just as the same thing that he would have done to be @@UNKNOWN@@ with two years ago .
You could do that .
It 's an absolutely crazy and crazy story with images images to remember you to remember that the first thing about this crazy crazy thing .
And then you go to your house and look at the south of Mr. @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And that would remember you , thank friend friend .
And if you look at @@UNKNOWN@@ , you 're looking at a joke that you 're talking about .
You go to your kitchen , and the fourth thing you 're talking about , was this strange journey that you have for a year . And you 've got some friends to help you .
That 's why they did n't talk to the front of their @@UNKNOWN@@ -- not the word for the word , which is just because it 's just a matter of subject .
The English term " @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , " which is a subject called @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is from the @@UNKNOWN@@ word " @@UNKNOWN@@ , " which means "
These are the things that people were talking about @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ in terms of terms .
The question " first . "
I thought that all the fascinating and I 'm still there .
And some of the memory @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I wanted to give something a little bit about this @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But there was a problem .
The problem is that memory memory are events .
It 's like a group of people who are sitting there and write a test .
It 's exciting when someone gets to the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I 'm a journalist , I need something to do it .
I know that the @@UNKNOWN@@ things in the people do this , but I have no access to it .
So if I wanted to tell this story , I had to put it in their position .
And that 's what I started to do every morning or 20 minutes before I started with my newspaper .
Perhaps a poem .
The name from a old @@UNKNOWN@@ , which I bought on the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I had to say that it 's so much fun .
I could never imagine that .
It 's fun because it 's not about trying to train memory .
You want to be better and better to get these crazy , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , funny , hopefully , and hopefully @@UNKNOWN@@ images in your inner eye .
I @@UNKNOWN@@ myself .
Here 's me with my standard @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
A couple of @@UNKNOWN@@ and a @@UNKNOWN@@ that 's going to be small in two little @@UNKNOWN@@ , because we have the largest enemy of the memory system .
I went to the same competition that I had a year ago .
And to me , @@UNKNOWN@@ , just to do this as an experiment .
It could be a nice @@UNKNOWN@@ for my research .
The problem was that the experiment was not like @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I won the competition , which really should n't have done .
It was nice to talk about , and the phone data , but I was n't what I wanted to do .
These are just tricks .
@@UNKNOWN@@ work , because they 're very simple ideas about how the brain works .
You do n't have to build @@UNKNOWN@@ , or you 're going to be able to take away from the understanding of how your brain works .
We often talk about people with good memory when it was a special way , but that 's not true .
Good @@UNKNOWN@@ are trained .
We realize things better than we listen .
We remember if we 're involved .
We remember if we have the opportunity to find out of why information and experiences for us , why they have meaning and meaning , if we can make it into something that we can think about us in our
The @@UNKNOWN@@ , these @@UNKNOWN@@ , they are all the poetry .
In fact , it 's not even an @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They work because they do n't work .
They do n't help us and pay attention to a way that we do n't normally .
But it 's not .
That 's how things happen in the memory .
One thing I want to give you on the way of doing something that I feel through the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the man who do n't even have been back to the moment that we 've learned our lives .
How much are we ready to do it in our short short life that we 're moving on our own or our iPhone or our iPhone , instead of human beings with us talking to us ? How much are
I learned that this memory , in each of us , incredible capacity .
If we want to live a life life , we need to be the person who do n't forget .
Thank you .
In the age of 27 , I left a job job in the @@UNKNOWN@@ for a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In public schools in New York , I was @@UNKNOWN@@ for mathematics .
How many teachers , I decided to do tests and tests .
I did homework .
When the work works , I wrote notes .
And that was not the only difference between the best and worst students .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ of my first students were not @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Some of my children children do n't care very well .
That 's what I think .
What you do in the seven year . You 're learning in math , and it 's hard .
But I do n't have these concepts . I was convinced of all that my students could learn the stuff that they could work and hard enough .
And after a few years ago , I came up to the end that we have a much better understanding of education and learning from a perspective of motivation , from a psychological perspective .
What do we measure in education in the best measure of the test , but what if you 're going to school in school and lives of a much more important than the ability to make it easy ?
So , I left the classroom , and I had a student to @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And I started to children and children in all sorts of hard - hand situation , and I asked , who is successful and why ?
My team and I went to West West @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We tried to predict what the @@UNKNOWN@@ were going to stay down and not .
We went to national national and tried to make sure that children were going to come up .
We looked at @@UNKNOWN@@ , which were very difficult to work , and they said , the teachers were working at the end of the year and teach them that they were able to improve the most of their students
We were connected with private companies , and the question that people were doing their job .
And who would make the most money .
In all of these different cultures , they have an important amount of attention to success .
We were not social intelligence .
It was not good .
It was @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ is passion and resilience for very long targets .
@@UNKNOWN@@ is @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Instead , if you do n't think about a @@UNKNOWN@@ , it 's not just for a week or a month , but for years , and really hard work to make this plan .
@@UNKNOWN@@ is life like a marathon .
In a few years ago , I started working in public schools in Chicago .
I asked thousands of students at the bottom of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I was waiting for a year to see who did that .
And it turns out that children children have higher higher levels , which eventually , when I do all of the characteristics of the things , like @@UNKNOWN@@ , results at the tests , even how sure they felt in
So it 's not only in @@UNKNOWN@@ , and at the @@UNKNOWN@@ , but also in school , especially for children with children .
The most important thing about this issue is that I do n't know that the science is so little about it , how to build it .
Every day and ask me , and teachers , " How do we support the hope of children ? "
How do I teach a better work ?
How do I hold it for @@UNKNOWN@@ ? "
The honest answer : I do n't know .
But what I know is that you have no evidence alone .
Our data is clear that many of people who are just not going to be true .
In fact , the result of our knowledge do n't normally do n't work , but it 's even @@UNKNOWN@@ with talent .
That 's the best idea that I heard about the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the brain that 's called @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So this idea was developed at the University of Stanford University at Stanford University , and I believe that the ability to learn is that the ability to learn , is that they can change with your brain .
Dr. @@UNKNOWN@@ has shown that children when they learn about the brain , and learn how to change the response to the challenges , and growing up in a very much more likely because they do n't believe it 's
This is an amazing idea that 's a great idea for the building of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But we need more .
So here 's what I 'm going to do with my hand , and we 're just so far .
That 's the work that 's going on .
We need to make our best ideas , and we 're going to be able to predict the results .
We need to measure whether we should be successful . We need to be ready to fail to be wrong , to learn from learning and learn from the beginning .
In other words , we need to help our children to give more children .
Thank you very much .
In the center of my work , the connection of @@UNKNOWN@@ to our @@UNKNOWN@@ and part of the environment , where architecture is natural to the natural natural environment , and traditions .
Today , I have an example for example , @@UNKNOWN@@ today 's projects .
Both of them are in South Africa , one in Ethiopia and one of them .
They also have together that the different kinds of different ways of an important part of the visual architecture .
The first example started with an invitation , an @@UNKNOWN@@ Center in Ethiopia capital capital capital .
This is the kind of building that tells us , my team and me , as an example of what we wanted to design .
First , I thought I wanted to go .
After we had a few of these buildings -- we have many of them in the city -- we realized that they have three properties .
The first one of these buildings are almost empty , because they 're very large @@UNKNOWN@@ in people who ca n't afford to buy things .
Second , they need a lot of energy , because the surfaces of glass , which heat into something , and then you need a lot .
In a city where this would n't happen , because they have pretty bad weather , which is all over between 20 to 25 degrees .
And third , you have nothing to do with Africa and Ethiopia .
That 's a little bit of a place with a very rich culture and tradition .
And also , I was very first at the first @@UNKNOWN@@ of the old market with this @@UNKNOWN@@ structure , where thousands of people go and buy a day , little small .
It also has this idea of public space that uses the function to use activity .
So I thought , this is exactly what I really want to do , I do n't want to go through the ice .
But the question was , how we could create a @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ building with these principles .
The next challenge was , when we looked at the site , because it 's in a right @@UNKNOWN@@ of the city , which is most of the buildings that you see on the image , yet not .
Also , it 's between two @@UNKNOWN@@ that are over hundreds of feet .
First of all , we created a connection between these two streets , and we put all the buildings of the building .
That 's what 's going on in a @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is a @@UNKNOWN@@ room in the building , which is moving through its own shape itself , and rain .
In order to take this @@UNKNOWN@@ , the idea of a market with small plants , which is in every floor , because of the shape of the brain .
I started thinking , how do we end the building ?
I really wanted to find a solution to the local community .
I started thinking about how to make a dish from concrete with @@UNKNOWN@@ , which air the air , and the light , but in @@UNKNOWN@@ form .
Then inspired me with these beautiful @@UNKNOWN@@ on the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They created the properties of a geometry , and that helped me to create the whole wall .
We do this with these small @@UNKNOWN@@ , the windows , the air and light on the way to build buildings .
And that 's going to get through these little , white @@UNKNOWN@@ , the light from the @@UNKNOWN@@ to use the building at night .
It was n't just going to convince the ideas with these ideas , because they thought , " This is not the mall . We do n't have the @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
But then we realized that this idea of the market is much more important than the idea of @@UNKNOWN@@ , because they can sell more oil .
Now , the concept of the ice was much , much cheaper , not only because of the material , but also because we did n't need air air .
So we created a few of us that we used to study the project .
The first step was to think about how we could make the building buildings , in a city , which almost almost every day .
We created a value of @@UNKNOWN@@ by the @@UNKNOWN@@ on the roof .
And that 's what we call us the roof as a new public room with @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ , the urban urban .
These @@UNKNOWN@@ on the top of the water at the bottom of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I hope the next year , because we 've created the building up to the five .
The second example is an innovation for 2,000 projects and institutions in the world .
So , to make a big project , the largest project I 've ever designed , I had to understand the city , but also the environment , the tradition and the culture .
While this analysis , I especially especially at the top , which is the 1,000 years old , the wall of a wall of @@UNKNOWN@@ , through 12 @@UNKNOWN@@ , and by almost 20 lines .
When I went to the site , the first step to make the streets streets to the first 12 of them , with similar size and properties like the @@UNKNOWN@@ in Europe and in Europe .
In addition , we 're going to see some of the points in the end of this concept , and they follow them straight lines , and it changed the original pattern .
The last step was thinking about the cell , the small cell of the project , like the apartment , as a part of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
What would be the best leader in a @@UNKNOWN@@ climate for a apartment ?
That 's North @@UNKNOWN@@ , because of the @@UNKNOWN@@ between the two @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is created , and a natural @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So we put a pattern about it , which is that most of these are perfectly perfect perfect in the direction .
And this is the result , it 's almost like a combination of a European building and the Arab city .
There are the three - dimensional devices , and in the ground floor , there are all these kinds of connections .
It also also created the local @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is a higher density in the upper @@UNKNOWN@@ and a lower density in the ground floor .
It also also the concept of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So , the amount of this kind of form form that @@UNKNOWN@@ itself through three different @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and it also @@UNKNOWN@@ in very low - level structure of the light on the ground floor .
The roof , my favorite place in this project , the community is almost the room back to the space of the building .
There are all the neighbors coming together and come together , and things like a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ on the morning , from a building to another .
These two examples have a common approach to design .
They 're in South countries where you can see the cities in the world .
In the cities , the impact of architecture in the world today and future life are going to live the local communities , and how fast the buildings grow .
For this reason , I think it 's important , architecture 's simple , but sustainable solutions , the relationship between the community and the environment , and the way of nature and nature .
Thank you very much .
I want to talk about trust , and I want to think about the traditional opinions of trust .
They 're so popular that they have become @@UNKNOWN@@ .
There 's something I think about three .
First of one , you say , trust is strong in the population , many people .
Then a goal : we should trust more .
And one task : We should trust the trust .
I believe that the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the goal and the task on the wrong .
I want to tell you a different story about a statement , a goal and a task to make a much better approach to the thing .
It 's just saying the reason : Why do people think that trust is @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
And if I really think about my current technology , I do n't know the answer .
Maybe it 's in some of the activities , or in the end of the world , and in other words .
I was missing the idea .
But I can look at some of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is yes to be the source for the faith that the trust is @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Look at the last time , and it 's not a lot of evidence for it .
In fact , the people who are watching 20 years ago , mostly popular and politicians , still @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And the people that were 20 years ago , and it 's still very familiar : @@UNKNOWN@@ , nurses .
We 're in the way .
But is that a good evidence ?
@@UNKNOWN@@ .
What could they do ?
So you look at the general question of people when they ask certain questions .
Do you trust the trust ?
So if you asked me , trust ?
@@UNKNOWN@@ trust ?
@@UNKNOWN@@ trust ?
I would ask you , " Well , right ? "
And that would be a bad response .
And if you look at the answer , you may say , " I trust some of them , but not . "
@@UNKNOWN@@ .
In short , we 're going to try to live in our short life , trust in different ways .
We do n't go out of all of us , we do n't know what we 're going to do , or @@UNKNOWN@@ in a leader or an institution .
So I could say , I 'm going to tell you that I could find a little bit of good @@UNKNOWN@@ to the first grade that I could n't do it , but I would n't drive them to school
Maybe I do n't know that she does n't really good car .
I also believe that my @@UNKNOWN@@ friend has a conversation to work , but maybe not that it 's a secret .
Simple .
So , how do we know from our life , how different trust can look like , but why do n't we know this knowledge that if we think more abstract ?
There are some very bad things about the actual @@UNKNOWN@@ , because they feel the common sense that you use in @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Second , we come to the goal .
The goal is to trust more .
In fact , I say that the stupid thing .
I 'm not going to focus .
I would try trying to trust the more @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ but not .
I 'm actually going to focus on it , not to trust .
And those , for example , their performance in the hands of a certain gentleman , which he said , " The name of his name was @@UNKNOWN@@ , because of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , " @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
" @@UNKNOWN@@ trust " is not a smart goal in this life .
@@UNKNOWN@@ smart and to be the goal .
And then you say , well , okay , what 's the most important , is not trust , but it turns out .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ of people can make .
And to do that , we need to do three things .
Are they win ? Are they honest ? Are you it ?
If we find a person in the issues of @@UNKNOWN@@ , and you can find it , we have a good reason to trust it , and it 's @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But the person , but not yet .
Some of my friends are @@UNKNOWN@@ and honest , but I would n't put them a letter , because they 're @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I have friends who are very , very much in their own trust , but they 've got a lot of them .
And I 'm very happy about that I do n't have a lot of friends , which are @@UNKNOWN@@ , and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But if I did n't understand it .
But then we 're looking at it .
@@UNKNOWN@@ is the response .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ has to be missing . That 's not hard .
Over the last decades , we tried to do all of the world , and in experts , and experts in experts and @@UNKNOWN@@ , we make it easier to make their protein .
Many of these systems have the opposite effect .
They do n't work like @@UNKNOWN@@ .
One @@UNKNOWN@@ once said to me , " The problem is that the @@UNKNOWN@@ longer longer than the baby gets into the world . "
And in our public life , in our institutions , this issue on the problem .
It @@UNKNOWN@@ people like @@UNKNOWN@@ percent of their hard tasks by doing it .
In fact , I can do any examples .
So much the goal .
So the goal is to realize , and this will be difficult if we want to be connected , and we want to communicate with other people , and if we want to be sure whether other people , or
It 's not easy . You have to do it . They do n't get the answers , or answers , they do n't get enough .
And now .
This as a @@UNKNOWN@@ of faith to describe it again .
Because it suggests that you should and trust trust .
We can do that for us .
We can win a little @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So , two people can trust their trust .
But finally , trust is that there is another one .
You ca n't do that again , which is another .
You have to give them a foundation that they trust .
So you have to be moved .
That 's because of course , you do n't normally do all of people in the middle of your nose .
But you also need to make sure that you 're spread .
How is that ?
This happens every day , everywhere . Good people do it , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , very effective .
Here 's a simple example .
The store I 'm going to do is to make my @@UNKNOWN@@ , and she makes me bring them back , and they do n't ask questions .
They take it back and give me the money back , or a few of the @@UNKNOWN@@ in the color color .
That 's great . I trust them , because they showed me to vulnerable .
It 's a lot of morality .
If you 're in front of the people as a vulnerable , that 's a very good evidence that you can spread , and you can think of their own words .
So our goal is actually not very hard to recognize .
It 's relationships between people , and the @@UNKNOWN@@ , when and other people are different .
So the moral of the story is very , very much less than trust , or thinking about change , trust , or from politics , or @@UNKNOWN@@ , and a lot more about @@UNKNOWN@@ , and how do people
Thank you .
You know , the best part of the @@UNKNOWN@@ are for me for the films I can see .
I love it , my own @@UNKNOWN@@ with my children with my children . When my daughter were four years old , we were together , " The magician of " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
The film has no more @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Their @@UNKNOWN@@ was , of course .
So she had a good joke to make a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and a magic @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But if you look at this movie , it 's enough enough to see how it really is .
We live in the world today and moving our children in a kind of a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But " The magician of @@UNKNOWN@@ " was different .
He did n't follow this trend .
It took 40 years until this trend is @@UNKNOWN@@ , with -- interesting -- a different film , which is a guy made of metal and a guy with a lot of eight - a - time - old girl
You know what I 'm talking about ?
Right .
Now , there 's a big difference between these two films , even a lot of different differences between " The magician of @@UNKNOWN@@ and all the movies that we see today .
First of all , there is " The magician of @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
The monkeys are pretty powerful , also like the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But I think if " The magician of @@UNKNOWN@@ , " today , has been going to be a magician that said , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , you 're the @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ who was once @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ your magic shoes to make computers from computers using the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of the West .
But it does n't happen .
One another thing that I 'm going to see is a magician of ignorance , which is very unique , is that the @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ and even the characters are female female .
So I noticed that first time when I was my daughter , " I was like , " I said , " and I said , " which was later , and the situation was different .
At that point , I had a son .
He was at three years old .
He was not at the @@UNKNOWN@@ . He was still too young .
But he was the second kid , and it was much less than his sister .
So he was a guy , and he 's got the film , like a @@UNKNOWN@@ his mother , and I did n't think he understood that what was going on , but he did it quite sure it was
And I asked myself what he did .
Did he feel that it was courage , @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Did he have an @@UNKNOWN@@ of an army @@UNKNOWN@@ to government government ?
He did n't know that there are only boys in the universe , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and , of course , that she 's really cool , but during the most days , so they have the heroes with a
Try that with " The magician of @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
How does n't make his film to a good end ?
By changing with all @@UNKNOWN@@ and a leader .
This is the kind of world I 'm going to do my children rather than -- -- is n't it -- and not in the world , in the guys who are talking about what we 're doing right now
Why does it have a lot of power -- big analogy , power -- in the movies that there are our children , and so little yellow @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
There 's a lot of the literature literature about the impact of the films that have been talking about their boys on girls , and they should read it . It 's very good .
But yet , I did n't read that much about how things with this impact .
I know from my experience that the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ did n't have the visual model that I could use to use through the world of adults , in the girls and boys .
I think there was this moment with the first moment when I was going to expect that the @@UNKNOWN@@ begins , because it does n't like a film , or ?
I 've finished my mission , I 've got this girl .
Why are you there ?
I do n't know what I do .
The films are very important to make the bad people , and they follow his reward , and there 's not a lot of space for other relationships and others .
It seems almost like if you 're as a boy , when you 're a boy animal , and if you 're a girl , you should be able to bring his @@UNKNOWN@@ .
There are some exceptions , and I 'm going to be able to buy the @@UNKNOWN@@ -- every one of you today .
But they 're going to give a message to the boy that the boys are not the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They 're beautiful in the girl who teach them how to fight against the @@UNKNOWN@@ , but they do n't tell the boys do n't know how to fight them .
There are no models for them .
There are also a lot of women who are going to write new stories for our children and so @@UNKNOWN@@ and wonderful @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ , and they 're still @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And the most successful studio of all the time , of course , is a classic after the other , and every single one of them is about the third of a boy or a man or a man or
Until -- how many of you probably think -- and this year , when they finally got the film " @@UNKNOWN@@ -- @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
I recommend it . He 's on the Internet .
Remember , what the @@UNKNOWN@@ said , " @@UNKNOWN@@ "
" Oh , I ca n't believe that @@UNKNOWN@@ has a @@UNKNOWN@@ movie . "
He 's very good . Let 's not do that .
But as well as none of these films have the @@UNKNOWN@@ test .
I do n't know if you 've heard about it .
He does n't have that right now , and yet , but what we 're going to do today is a movement .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ is a book - @@UNKNOWN@@ , and she was in the middle of the ' 80s , which she had with a friend of telling the films that they saw .
It 's quite simple . There are only three questions that you have to imagine : Is it more than a character in the movie , the female is a little bit something ?
Try again to do that .
And talk about women women at the point of the time ?
And it 's in your conversation with something else than the guy that they like ?
Right ? Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Two women who have exist and talk about something .
That 's a little bit . I 've seen it , and yet , I see it very rare in the movies that we know and love .
In fact , I went back to this week , to look at a very good film , " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
You remember it 's much more @@UNKNOWN@@ at the @@UNKNOWN@@ , great @@UNKNOWN@@ , a general advantage of what a good news is .
He 's going to @@UNKNOWN@@ with the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I think it should n't be , because a lot of the @@UNKNOWN@@ -- I do n't know if you 've seen it -- but a lot of the film is in a message where men and women are sitting
There are some good @@UNKNOWN@@ in the men in the middle of a deep deep - fear conversation , and the great moment that has one of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , is through a door to @@UNKNOWN@@ and say , "
So here 's some Hollywood .
So let 's take a look at the numbers .
In the United States , under the most popular popular stories , what do you think about how many of them were in female ?
@@UNKNOWN@@ . That 's not bad .
It 's not so many @@UNKNOWN@@ like the number of women that we 've just just launched in Congress .
But there 's a number that 's bigger than that , and that 's the space that 's going to be space .
Last year , the New York Times Times a study that the government did .
It says that .
One of five women in the United States States that it was in their lives .
I do n't think it 's the @@UNKNOWN@@ of general general .
I do n't believe that you have to do something .
I do n't even think that music and videos do n't have to do something , but something that 's wrong , and if I hear these statistics , it 's one of the things that I think is that
Who are these guys ? What do they learn ?
What do they do n't learn ?
Take the story that it 's the task of a male hero , the @@UNKNOWN@@ with violence , and then the reward reward , which is a woman who does n't have friends and does n't speak ?
Take this story ?
You know , as a parent , the privilege , who has a daughter , just like the ones that you can do that , and we 're going to find the world and the statistics , we want to
We have tools , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , " and we hope that this is going to help , but I wonder , if you do n't protect them , whether it 's going to protect us , at the same
The @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ is a tool that we can do something very important , and I 'm going to talk to you with that .
I think we need to have to have a new definition of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The definition of @@UNKNOWN@@ is already changing .
They read how the New @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They 'll be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We need to be able to find a way to make the sense to create a new relationship , and I think we need to show you that it 's a real man , who 's going to feel their
I think we should be able to look at the movies of looking for films , which is the @@UNKNOWN@@ test , if we can find them , and after the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the evidence is to prove the people
When I asked my daughter , who she @@UNKNOWN@@ in " Star @@UNKNOWN@@ , " you know what she said ? "
@@UNKNOWN@@ - @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
What have these two common together ?
Maybe it 's not just the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I think these two characters are experts .
These are the two characters in the film that are more familiar than all other people , and they 'd love to share with other people to help them with their potential .
It 's also leader .
I like this kind of work for my daughter and I like this kind of task for my son .
I want to make more things like this .
I want to do less tasks that I 'm going to say to my son , " Let 's go ahead and fight alone , and more tasks that he can connect with a team , which is a team
Thank you very much .
I want to talk to you about the story of a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I do n't name his name , but it 's his story .
He lives in a small village in south .
His village is close to close .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ went to poverty poverty and the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
When there was nothing more than what he was there , he left his village and went to the city , in this case , @@UNKNOWN@@ , capital capital .
When he gets there , there are no options , no work , no way .
At the end , he comes in one outside outside of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It may be a year , but nothing .
One day , he 's going to talk about a man who would take him to lunch lunch , and after dinner , after the breakfast .
He sees this dynamic group of young people , and they give him a chance .
He gets a little money to buy new clothes and buy money at home to his family .
It 'll be this young woman .
He finally .
He starts a new life .
His life has a sense .
In a beautiful day , in @@UNKNOWN@@ , a @@UNKNOWN@@ in the air .
This @@UNKNOWN@@ with @@UNKNOWN@@ was the @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ and the dynamic group of young people to be al - @@UNKNOWN@@ , an @@UNKNOWN@@ with al al Qaeda .
How could the story of a @@UNKNOWN@@ , so that just just tried to go into the middle of the city , that he could actually put themselves in the air ?
He was waiting .
He was waiting for a chance to go to the future , on a way , and it was the first opportunity to help him .
It was the first thing that he @@UNKNOWN@@ out of a state that we call " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
And his story again and again again in the urban urban areas around the world .
It 's the story of @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ urban cities , which is @@UNKNOWN@@ in London and London , and after something else than " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
A lot of people believe that of the city , of their @@UNKNOWN@@ , opportunities , work , wealth , but young people do n't have any of the wealth of their cities .
In fact , it 's the youth , which is under the high seas .
In the United States , three of five people live in the cities are more than 18 years .
If we do n't help people in the growth of cities , if we do n't give them an opportunity to make it , then , " @@UNKNOWN@@ " in the war , in the violence and in the world
In my birth , @@UNKNOWN@@ , 70 percent of the young people under 40 .
70 percent have no work , do n't go to school .
They do n't do anything .
Last month I went back to @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I went to the hospital hospital , the hospital where I was born .
I remember , when I was in front of the hospital hospital , and I asked , what if I would never be here ?
What if I was at the same state of the @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
Would I have been asked ?
I 'm not sure what I 'm going to say .
The reason for my day took this month in @@UNKNOWN@@ was actually the first one of the @@UNKNOWN@@ for young leaders and entrepreneurs .
I brought up with young young women .
We put together together , and we made a mathematical solutions for the largest challenges of their city .
In the room , a young man , @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He went to university at the University of @@UNKNOWN@@ , and there was his high school .
There was no work and no opportunities .
And I remember how he told me that he had a high school , and it was frustrated , the perfect goal , @@UNKNOWN@@ to al - @@UNKNOWN@@ and others .
They were watching people like him .
But this story takes another time .
In fact , the largest obstacles to come from A to B , the streets .
23 years ago , the @@UNKNOWN@@ lost @@UNKNOWN@@ , so this is the best @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And realized that the opportunity and she started .
He @@UNKNOWN@@ a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He started to hear @@UNKNOWN@@ in @@UNKNOWN@@ who could n't afford them .
With his family and friends , he bought 10 pounds , and he 's going to go back to the next three years in the next three years .
How is this story of others ?
What does the difference ?
I think it 's his ability to find a new opportunity and see it .
It 's the @@UNKNOWN@@ and I believe that the @@UNKNOWN@@ means " @@UNKNOWN@@ "
It makes young young people in the economic ways that they 're trying to protect them .
You can teach young people .
I want to talk to you with a young man who 's talking to a couple of my meeting : @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He helped me to bring some of these young young people who are going to go up at the top , and they show them how to create and innovative .
He 's actually the first @@UNKNOWN@@ that has been killed for 20 years ago , and until recently , before @@UNKNOWN@@ was there , they were artificial artificial @@UNKNOWN@@ , which was by @@UNKNOWN@@ , if you wanted to be
If you ask someone said , " When did you see the last time ? "
So I saw an opportunity .
He started a @@UNKNOWN@@ with @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He put a green outside of @@UNKNOWN@@ and began , and @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ , and how he said , in the @@UNKNOWN@@ of climate @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He started talking about flowers with flowers , and private private spaces and businesses around the city , and he 's working on the design of the first public park in Europe .
There 's no public park in @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He wants to create a place where families and young people come together , and how he says , the beautiful things of life can be alive .
Just so on the edge , he does n't have to do it because they do n't need much water .
So the first step is to young young people , and in this room had to be able to see some of the consequences of the other young people in the room .
They never really thought about a company company .
They thought it was for an organization or work for the government , but this story , his innovation , had a strong impact on them .
He @@UNKNOWN@@ her town as a place of opportunities .
He @@UNKNOWN@@ them to be entrepreneurs that they could change the change .
At the end of the day , they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges of their city .
They had @@UNKNOWN@@ solutions for local problems .
The inspiration of young people and the creation of a @@UNKNOWN@@ is a really big step , but young people need to save their ideas in the future .
They need @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ , to develop their business and their business .
Take a lot of people with the resources that they need to be connected , give them the support that they need to create ideas , and you 're going to be able to scale up for growth growth .
For me , I think more than just one of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's about creating social effects .
@@UNKNOWN@@ does n't just sell flowers .
I think he sold hope .
His name " @@UNKNOWN@@ , " if it 's created , the way of people think about their city .
@@UNKNOWN@@ has @@UNKNOWN@@ how to help him to get the @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He gave them the chance to get out of the self - state state of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
These young companies have an enormous impact on their cities .
So my prediction is : Do you young people to help me , and to help their own innovation , and you 're going to tell more stories about flowers and " @@UNKNOWN@@ " instead of @@UNKNOWN@@ and " @@UNKNOWN@@
Thank you very much .
In my childhood , she was one of my favorite @@UNKNOWN@@ , after @@UNKNOWN@@ on the @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ , because my parents said , " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
But these guys are hard to find .
They 're not sand .
But after a certain time , I developed a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And I started thinking , and patterns that help me .
And this developed into a passion to find things that love love and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And when I finally started to study @@UNKNOWN@@ , I realized that the eye looked at my eye eyes .
Because I grew up in Egypt with a little beach in @@UNKNOWN@@ , at a @@UNKNOWN@@ miles long , along the @@UNKNOWN@@ . And my @@UNKNOWN@@ grew up to the size of cities .
And this led me to use satellite satellite .
I had to see differently to see the past in a map .
I want to show you how we can see differently , if we use @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This is a site which is @@UNKNOWN@@ in the Arab Arab @@UNKNOWN@@ called @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And the site seems to be brown , and we 're using @@UNKNOWN@@ , and it 's going to be wrong with all color , which is going to be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
What you 're seeing here is the chemical elements of the landscape , and @@UNKNOWN@@ the ancient oldest .
What I 'm going to share with you today is how we use @@UNKNOWN@@ , to find a @@UNKNOWN@@ city , which is called the name of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and thousands of years ago .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ was the capital of the American Egypt , more than 400 years ago , in an era called @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , at the time .
The site is in the @@UNKNOWN@@ Al - Qaeda , and it 's very important , because it 's in the middle of a great artist for art art , architecture and religion .
@@UNKNOWN@@ knew that there was the site of @@UNKNOWN@@ -- somewhere somewhere in the @@UNKNOWN@@ , which was built by the two @@UNKNOWN@@ here , with the red circles , but somewhere in this massive @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This area is huge -- the area of four times three miles .
At the end of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , it was straight to the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and during his life changed , and it turned into the West , @@UNKNOWN@@ the city .
So how do you find a @@UNKNOWN@@ city in a whole landscape landscape .
They 're going to be able to find that the equivalent of the needle in the @@UNKNOWN@@ in the @@UNKNOWN@@ , with @@UNKNOWN@@ eyes and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That 's why we use @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ to map a map of the landscape , in order to be able to see changes .
And where the course of the last year .
But you 're looking at it , and this is very interesting , very easy to find this easy @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ with the circle that makes us as a potential position for the city .
So we were working with scientists scientists , to @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ what you can see here .
This is like @@UNKNOWN@@ in the ice , just rather than the structure of climate change , which is climate change , which is @@UNKNOWN@@ , the human @@UNKNOWN@@ system .
In a deep level of five feet , one of a lot of fat , @@UNKNOWN@@ , we found a @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This shows that in this case , for example -- @@UNKNOWN@@ , in five feet , we 're going to see a lot of hundreds of years ago , and then we can find the way back to the Middle
We also found @@UNKNOWN@@ -- @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ -- which shows that there 's a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This may not look at a lot , but if you look at the @@UNKNOWN@@ rocks that were from @@UNKNOWN@@ in the Middle East , and then you see exactly these rocks .
So we found a little bit of the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the site that went on to the Middle @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We also found evidence for a @@UNKNOWN@@ for the @@UNKNOWN@@ society , which shows that this is a very important city .
It turns out there 's no longer - term -- but we 're going to go back to the door back to draw a map .
And what 's important is that we have about @@UNKNOWN@@ for young people , who are trained in the @@UNKNOWN@@ , so they 're the ones that can make great discoveries .
So I wanted to start with my name from the Middle East -- it was maybe in the city of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
" knowledge to share is the largest of all of the world 's @@UNKNOWN@@ .
There 's nothing like this in the country . "
TED was not in 1984 .
So , in terms of course , at the point of 1984 , there was not a lot of a long - year - old city , and from the top .
You can compare to the @@UNKNOWN@@ at the beach .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
I grew up in India as a daughter of a @@UNKNOWN@@ of my life .
I 've been inspired by this incredible language .
But for a @@UNKNOWN@@ , she seems like @@UNKNOWN@@ the Great wall of China .
In the last few years , I asked myself how I could do this wall , so that everybody can help the interest in this complex language , and they learn .
I thought that a new quick way to help Chinese , was useful .
In the five years ago , I learned that every single line for every @@UNKNOWN@@ in the right sequence .
In the next 15 years , I learned every day of my new character .
We only have five minutes to be able to get a faster and simple way of useful .
A Chinese name is about about 20,000 people .
They just need 1,000 examples for a simple @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The most important 200 of you can give you to 40 percent of the simple literature in the world 's enough to understand enough enough to be able to put together , and the key data , or newspapers ,
Today , I start with eight properties to show you how the way works .
Are you ready ?
Take your mouth as much as possible , until it 's square .
This becomes a mouth .
This person goes .
" Man . "
If the @@UNKNOWN@@ for fire fire , a man with @@UNKNOWN@@ arms than when he was going to say , " @@UNKNOWN@@ ! "
This is a tree .
" @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
This is a mountain .
The Sun .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ for the door " looks like a @@UNKNOWN@@ from the West West .
These eight characters are @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They 're the @@UNKNOWN@@ to create a variety of shapes .
A person .
If someone else says , " he says , "
Are it more , and two things say , " and three and a crowd . "
If you have a human arms , it says , " He was so big . "
The person in mouth , he 's like @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He 's an " @@UNKNOWN@@ , " like , " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
A tree is a tree . And trees trees are together for a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Three together , for example .
Take a @@UNKNOWN@@ under the tree , and you have a " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
Take a mouth on top of it , it means " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
Simple , because a @@UNKNOWN@@ tree is pretty @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Remember the fire ?
Two fire together , " hot . "
Three fire together have lots of fire .
Let 's fire the fire under two trees , so it 's " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
For us , the sun is the source of wealth .
Two stars together " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
Three work are " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
If the sun and the moon , it means " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
In the context , it can also be the next day .
The sun goes across the horizon .
@@UNKNOWN@@ door , a board in the door . "
@@UNKNOWN@@ a mouth in the door , it says , " questions . "
@@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This person @@UNKNOWN@@ from the door . "
On the left is the woman .
Two women together have a struggle .
@@UNKNOWN@@ in three women .
We 've got 30 inches in .
With this way , you can get from the first eight eight million words .
The next group of eight different forms of other words in other words .
With a lot of effort , you can learn a couple of different characters like a Chinese Chinese language .
If we can ask these characters , we 'll start with them .
For example , the mountain of fire and fire together the @@UNKNOWN@@ , so a " volcano . "
We know , Japan is the country of the Sun .
That 's the Sun with the " @@UNKNOWN@@ , " because Japan is @@UNKNOWN@@ .
A sun with the origin , " Japan . "
A person behind Japan ?
One is Japanese .
The characters on two left are two mountains of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In the Chinese Chinese , it says , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , " Chinese Chinese @@UNKNOWN@@ her political neighbors into the mountains across the mountains .
Today , " @@UNKNOWN@@ "
A mouth , which says , where it goes to " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
That 's the slide that I remember this moment . Thank you very much .
Now , Steve Steve , @@UNKNOWN@@ of Los Angeles , one day by the streets in the middle of Los Angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
She came from a man , a African - American , American , @@UNKNOWN@@ , homeless , the homeless , the game of a game that only had two @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Many of you are going to tell the story , because of the @@UNKNOWN@@ article about this later , a book , which was @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , with Robert @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , when Steve @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ as a
@@UNKNOWN@@ left , and a @@UNKNOWN@@ , and 30 years later , he lived as a man on the streets of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in the center of Los Angeles .
I 'm going to read you to read all of the book , or read the movie , so you do n't just understand the wonderful stories that 's between these two men together , but also how the music
I met @@UNKNOWN@@ in the last year , in two years ago , in the @@UNKNOWN@@ of Disney Hall .
He just had one of the first - year - old @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I 'm going to be able to hear the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and came back to the stage to imagine .
He was talking to a very @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ sound about five - year - old @@UNKNOWN@@ , and Tony Clinton and talking about how the @@UNKNOWN@@ would never be able to read the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and the whole thing
We came up to the music music , and a few days later , I got an email , which was told that I was interested in @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I have to say that this is a medical treatment treatment , because he was already with the @@UNKNOWN@@ and with @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ , and you have to be able to kill him .
And as a result of it , it 's especially especially vulnerable for these galaxies , and it 's so bad , and it goes down to the streets in the streets of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and this @@UNKNOWN@@ and
And in the same way , in a way of course , when we started with our first three - year - year - old Hall , he had this @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in his eyes , and she lost .
He talked about invisible @@UNKNOWN@@ and smoke and about how to someone someone in his sleep .
I was afraid , I did n't know , but I was afraid that I could lose him that he could be able to be able to be able to speak his relationship with the same thing when I started
So I just started playing .
I played the first sentence of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And while I played , in my eyes , there was a full change that was going on .
It was , as if he was under the impact of an invisible cancer , a chemical response to the @@UNKNOWN@@ of my brain .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ anger , in understanding , in a feeling and curiosity .
And how through a miracle , he took his shoulder , and began to hear a little bit of @@UNKNOWN@@ about @@UNKNOWN@@ , and he asked me to play it at the end , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We started talking about music , talking about @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ and all the other @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ until @@UNKNOWN@@ to @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And I realized that it was n't just a @@UNKNOWN@@ of music about music , but it also had a close personal relationship .
He talked about her with a passion and a understanding that I could only be inspired by my colleagues in the @@UNKNOWN@@ of Los Angeles .
By the music of music , and talking about music , was from this @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ man who was just moved by the streets of Los Angeles , a @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ in high -
music is medicine .
For example , music means creativity .
Because the music allows him to give him his thoughts and @@UNKNOWN@@ with their imagination and creativity in something very @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And so he @@UNKNOWN@@ his @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I realized that this is the nature of art .
And this is the reason why we do music , so we can do something that we 're in all of deep deep deep inside , our emotions , through our imagination .
And the reality of that phrase us all of us , and moving , inspired and together .
So what 's going to do , it took the music back into a community of friends .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ force of the music brought him back to a family of musicians , and he realized that the talent talent and realized .
And I 'm going to go back with music , and if I do n't think about in the @@UNKNOWN@@ of Disney Hall , or Mary @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , because he reminds me of why I 've got to be
Thank you very much .
Bruno Giussani : Thank you . Thank you .
Robert Robert .
Robert Robert : I want to play something that I call the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I hope you .
So I have a lot of fish in my life .
I just loved two .
The first one was more like a passion .
It was a nice fish , @@UNKNOWN@@ , good @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , a @@UNKNOWN@@ on the Web .
What a fish .
But better , he became @@UNKNOWN@@ in the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the highest standards of sustainability .
So you could probably feel that he would sell him .
I had had a relationship with a beauty about several months .
One day , the leader of the company , and asked if I was able to go back from the sustainability of the farm .
" Of course , " I said .
So here 's a company that was trying to solve what this problem problem with our @@UNKNOWN@@ problem . How do we move to our fish ?
In the last 50 years , we have the oceans where we have forests forests .
It 's hard to avoid destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , they 're @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's almost nothing left .
So it may be bad or bad , @@UNKNOWN@@ , a part of our future .
A lot of arguments about it . @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ the environment , most of them , and they 're @@UNKNOWN@@ , we 're taking a lot .
He has a @@UNKNOWN@@ of 15 .
This is , 15 pounds @@UNKNOWN@@ , so you can get a pounds of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Not very sustainable .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , not very good .
So , finally , a company to try to do it right .
I wanted to argue .
The day before I saw the boss of the company for the company .
Let 's call him him .
" @@UNKNOWN@@ , " I said , " just about the facts right now , you 're famous to find out out of the sea that you do n't have the environment . "
" It 's true , " he said , " We 're so far out that the waste of our fish is not going to be missing . "
And then he said , " We 're basically a own world .
This is from the @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
" The best in the industry . "
@@UNKNOWN@@ to one , great .
" What do you do ? "
" @@UNKNOWN@@ protein " he said .
" Great , " I said .
And on this night , I was in the bed and thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
So I called the next day , a minute before the event .
I said , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , what are useful for protein ? "
He said he did n't .
Now , I did a few people in the company . No one could give me an answer answer , until I finally had to find the biologists biologists .
Let 's call him @@UNKNOWN@@ .
" @@UNKNOWN@@ , " I said , " What are the most important protein ? "
Well , he mentioned some of these , and some @@UNKNOWN@@ , and then he said , chicken chicken .
I said , " chicken chicken ? "
He said , " Yes , @@UNKNOWN@@ , skin , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ and food . "
I said , " How much percentage percent @@UNKNOWN@@ is chicken ? "
In the assumption of maybe two percent .
" Well , that 's about 30 percent , " he said .
I said , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , what 's sustainable to eat chicken to fish ? "
There was a long @@UNKNOWN@@ in the line , and he said , " There 's just too much chicken on the world . "
I @@UNKNOWN@@ from this fish .
No , not because I 'm a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I 'm even .
No , I actually @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ from this fish , because I have God in God , the fish after this conversation , chicken .
This second fish , which is a different way of love .
It 's the romantic way that you see in the way you ever get to fish fish fish , you know the fish .
I 've taken him first in a restaurant in @@UNKNOWN@@ .
One of a journalist journalist has been a lot of this guy at the end of this fish .
She has @@UNKNOWN@@ us .
He came on the table with a light , almost white white color .
He loved him @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Wait twice .
It was still @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Who can make a fish like that , after he was @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
I ca n't , but this guy .
Let 's call it up .
And no , he did n't fish the fish , and he 's not a friend .
He 's a student at @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This is a @@UNKNOWN@@ in the @@UNKNOWN@@ corner .
It 's close to the river of the river .
Until the @@UNKNOWN@@ was the farm in the hands of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They called @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , which basically basically .
They did that by making the country .
They built this complicated range of @@UNKNOWN@@ , and they found their water from the country and beyond the river .
Well , they could n't make sense that it did n't work .
And green was a disaster .
It took about 90 percent of birds to see what these are a lot of birds .
And so in France , an Indian company with @@UNKNOWN@@ the country .
What did they do ?
They have the river of water .
They literally broke the wheel .
Instead of taking the water , they use the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the water back to the water .
They were @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They created a thousand square -- @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ -- and they have @@UNKNOWN@@ and his company @@UNKNOWN@@ the Earth .
The farm is incredible .
I mean , you 've seen something like that .
They 're just looking at the horizon , a million miles away , and everything that they see are @@UNKNOWN@@ , and these @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I did n't have a long time ago .
He 's an incredible guy , three parts of Charles Darwin and a part of a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Okay ? So we were fighting , and we were fighting by the @@UNKNOWN@@ and I @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I broke down to my leg , and you 're in a moment .
Here he takes a rare @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So he mentioned @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And here , he 's looking at a pattern of @@UNKNOWN@@ that he @@UNKNOWN@@ to the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It turns out that you have the largest part of his career in the National National Park in Africa .
I asked him how he was going to be a fish @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He said , " fish ? I do n't know about fish .
I 'm an expert of relationships . "
And then it goes down , and it seems to be more familiar by rare birds and dolphins and strange @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And you do n't understand me that was really fascinating , you know , the @@UNKNOWN@@ community , so in the way .
It 's great , but I was in love .
And my head became weak about this @@UNKNOWN@@ piece of fish , which I had on the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So I got him up . I said , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , how does it fish that it 's so good ? "
He showed up with this .
" I know , boy , the algae , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the relationships that is incredible .
But what do eat eat fish fish ?
How is that ?
Now , he 's going to tell me that it 's such a rich system that fish fish eat in the wild .
The teeth , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is the fish fish .
The system is so healthy , it 's completely @@UNKNOWN@@ .
There 's no food .
The more of a farm that does n't use their animals ?
Later on the day , I went on this site with you , and I asked him , " Well , for a place that , of course , it seems to be different than any farm I 've ever
At the moment , it 's like to be a leader that had to be a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And we came up with the corner , and we gave up the most amazing view , thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of @@UNKNOWN@@ , and literally literally @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
" That 's success , " he said . "
" Look at her @@UNKNOWN@@ .
She @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
@@UNKNOWN@@ ? I was quite confused .
I said , " You , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , do n't @@UNKNOWN@@ your foot ? "
" Yes , " he said .
" We lose 20 percent of our fish and @@UNKNOWN@@ of birds .
Now , last year , there were thousands of birds birds more than 250 different species .
It 's the largest and one of the most important private @@UNKNOWN@@ in our Europe .
I said , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , is a good @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , but the last one you would have to have a @@UNKNOWN@@ ? "
He broke his head , no .
He said , " We 're building @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This is a @@UNKNOWN@@ network .
@@UNKNOWN@@ eat the fish .
The fish eat the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the gut , the better system . "
Okay , let 's think about this . A farm that does n't save their animals , and a farm that their success at the health of its diet .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , but also a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Oh , and by the way , this may not be there .
They 're looking at a city of a half miles away where the @@UNKNOWN@@ is better for the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Every morning , they 're going to go back to @@UNKNOWN@@ miles .
And all night , they go back to 20 miles .
They do this because it 's the white white line of the @@UNKNOWN@@ line of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ .
I had a kind of journey of the penguins , so I looked at it .
I said , " Are you going to go back and take it back to the farm , and they fly it back to the night ?
Do they do that for children ? "
He looked at me when I had just been a song from @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He said , " No . You do that because the food is better . "
I did n't have the skin of my favorite fish that was cute , and I do n't like @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ . I do n't like it .
It 's the @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ taste .
I 'm not going to do that .
And yet , when I did it in this restaurant , in fact , she did n't try it at any time .
She loved cute , and it 's like if you take a @@UNKNOWN@@ from the ocean .
I mentioned that with you , and he @@UNKNOWN@@ him .
He said , " The skin works like a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's the last year before something in the body .
She has evolved through evolution .
And then he said , " But our water has no @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
Okay . A farm that does n't eat their fish , a farm , which is their success success at its success .
And then I realized that when he says , a farm that does n't have a @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , because the water that 's going through this farm is coming from the river .
It 's a river that all of the things that lead to us , from the rivers today , they tend to lead to some chemical chemical , @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And when it moves through the system , and that leaves the water , as it 's @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The system is so healthy , it takes water .
So it 's not just a farm that does n't eat their animals , not just a farm that their success at the health of them , but it 's a farm that 's literally a water -- it 's
Because when the water @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ it in the Pacific .
A drop of the ocean , I know , but I 'm going to take it , and that 's what you should do , because these stories , like love , and also .
You might say that it 's a recipe for the future , whether we talk about @@UNKNOWN@@ or @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , from one of the food that 's really good .
But for many people , this is a little bit radically .
We 're not @@UNKNOWN@@ , we 're @@UNKNOWN@@ . We 're @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We love @@UNKNOWN@@ . We love little @@UNKNOWN@@ . We talk about food food . We eat organic .
And if you say that the things are the things that are going to be the future of food food , and he says , " Hey people , I love @@UNKNOWN@@ , but how do you eat the world
How are you going to eat the world ? "
Can I be honest ?
I do n't like that question .
No , not because we have enough calories to make the world more than only .
One billion people are today .
One billion -- that 's more than ever before -- because @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in the distribution , not @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Now , I do n't like this question , because it does n't use the logic of our @@UNKNOWN@@ over the last 50 years .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ of chemicals , chemicals on the Earth , chicken in fish , and the whole time has been the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and he said , " If we eat more people , you can
That was the reason . It was the @@UNKNOWN@@ . It was the business of American agriculture .
We should call them what it is , a @@UNKNOWN@@ in @@UNKNOWN@@ , a @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is fast - @@UNKNOWN@@ capital , which is exactly this production .
That 's not an industry , and it 's not agriculture .
Our @@UNKNOWN@@ today is not treated because of @@UNKNOWN@@ , but because of resources resources .
It 's not through the latest @@UNKNOWN@@ and the @@UNKNOWN@@ , but by the country , not through @@UNKNOWN@@ , but it 's not fresh water , not through @@UNKNOWN@@ , but through forests , and not through @@UNKNOWN@@ and
They want to make the world ?
Let 's start with the question : How are we going to feed us ?
Or better , how can we create the conditions that each community can help themselves ?
To do that , you do n't look at the @@UNKNOWN@@ model for the future .
It 's really old , and it 's done .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , chemistry and machines , and it does n't have something really good for food .
Let 's look at the green model .
That 's one that 's two billion years of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Look at @@UNKNOWN@@ , farmers like @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , not the worlds for them , companies , which is rather than @@UNKNOWN@@ , but the @@UNKNOWN@@ , rather than low , farmers , not only , are experts , but experts for relationships .
Because they are the people who are experts for their taste .
And if I 'm really honest , they 're a better friend than I will ever be .
You know , this is me right , because if that 's the future , it 's cute .
Thank you .
If I want to tell you today , I want it to be that the whole data of the data that we consume is larger than the size of their parts and instead of thinking about @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So what we see here is a typical @@UNKNOWN@@ old age .
The program I use here is a little experiment .
It 's like , and what I can do with it is that I can go to a certain cause of what we can prevent .
And I see a different pattern that makes it .
And that 's because in the @@UNKNOWN@@ here , the people on the brain are , and they 're over here at @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We can take a step further and see the data , and we see that @@UNKNOWN@@ and cancer are the most common , but not for everyone .
Now , if we go down and go to the age , we say 40 years or younger , we 're going to see that the power is even the most important thing about people to worry .
And who 's looking at the fact that this is especially in men .
So you realize that the reputation of information and data in this way that it 's very dangerous to live in a living @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And if we can do that for data , why do n't have content for content ?
Now , what we 've got here is the @@UNKNOWN@@ of each one , " The @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ " which has ever been published .
It 's all here . It 's all online .
They 'd like to think of my talk in your lab .
With them , they can go through a decade .
You can go into a particular year .
You can go directly to a certain issue .
So if I look at this , I see the metaphor that are in this copy and the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So I 'm going to have an @@UNKNOWN@@ Feynman , so I 'm going to take this point where I 'm going to show you all the data that I 'm going to say .
Now , if I just want to take a look at the idea , I think , " OK , what if I look at all of the subject ? "
So I 'm going to go back and @@UNKNOWN@@ the view .
Now I see @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And so you get a idea of that if you 're looking at this kind of information , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , but you do n't look at it , or not just simply .
You do something that 's actually a little different .
It 's something between , and we think it changes the way we can use information .
So I want to take this idea a little bit more about something about a little crazy .
What we 've done here is we 've got every single @@UNKNOWN@@ , and we 're going to put a little bit down .
And I 'm going to give you a quick note and a symbol for the area of it .
I 'm just going to make the top of the top of the top of the top @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But even in this perspective , we can do lots of things .
Now , when we get a sense of what they 're talking about Wikipedia ,
I 'm going to use the issue of government .
Now , after I said , " I chose to see that the @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is most of the time - @@UNKNOWN@@ Time magazine . "
This is really important , because this is a discovery that 's not in a single @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's just to realize if you take a step back and look at it .
@@UNKNOWN@@ on a particular one that I can do in the subject of Time magazine , " people in the year , and all together .
So if I look at all of these people , I realize that the majority of them are going to come from some of the science . Some of them , less , from the economy . Here 's my
And most importantly , it 's going to TED TED .
So we can jump and take a look at all of TED TED .
You can see , in the Web , the first time when it 's really a net , not just by the side , but a lot more abstract .
And so I want to show you what else would be a little surprise .
I 'm just going to show you the New York Times .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , this application -- I do n't want to write a web ; it 's not a web , but you can look at the website -- and we bring these @@UNKNOWN@@ technology to each other website like this
So I can go back a step , and I 'm going to move to a specific @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So this is important because you 're just through the @@UNKNOWN@@ of pages in this way , and all the Internet -- the same way in the same way .
So I can go in my mind in a moment of time .
Here 's the state of the whole demonstration that I 've come up with .
And I can look at everything I 've been looking at today , again .
And when I go back and step back , and I can look at my whole new way of looking at my @@UNKNOWN@@ -- so I 've been looking for " @@UNKNOWN@@ , " and I 'm going to live
And from here , I can go into the side and go back again .
It 's a metaphor that 's always used again , and every time it makes the big bigger than the sum of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
At the moment , in this world , we think we 're data data .
We 're talking about @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We 're talking about " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
What if we could turn this situation , and the Internet on the head , so that we do n't always want to go from a different way to start with lots of things , and how do you see
If we can do that , then it 'll be able to get this @@UNKNOWN@@ , maybe a new source of information .
And instead of just moving into information , we can get knowledge .
And if we can learn knowledge , we can even be able to pull it out .
So I hear that thank you very much .
I grew up with a @@UNKNOWN@@ of science fiction .
In my school , I went up with the bus to school , every day a hour .
And my nose was always in a book , a science fiction -- a book book , that my thought in other worlds , and in my way , in deep ways , I have curiosity .
These curiosity also showed me that I was always when I was not in the school , through the forests , @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ , and @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ , all at home , and under the microscope
I was completely @@UNKNOWN@@ , you know .
It was always trying to understand the world to understand the world of the possibility .
And my love to read fiction fiction in my environment , because in the late ' 60s , we went to the moon and the ocean .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in our living room with his fascinating show that we looked at and places and a world full of wonder that we could never have ever seen .
And that 's good at the science of science fiction .
And I was artists .
I could draw . I could paint .
And there 's not a video video games of these @@UNKNOWN@@ with the films that have been the whole material in the media landscape , I had to create the images in my head .
So we had all the time back , when we started when we read a book , we took the description of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and we put them on the screen in our minds .
My response to this was the drawing and painting of @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ worlds , robots , @@UNKNOWN@@ and all of that .
In fact , I was getting out of the teacher , and I was like @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The creativity needed me .
And this was something interesting . What I was talking about at @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ was the idea of a very different world here on our Earth .
Now , I would never make an unexpected world with a @@UNKNOWN@@ . That seemed to be quite unexpected .
But here was a world that I could actually see in the Earth , and she was just fascinating and fascinating about all of the things that I 've been told , and I read this books .
So I decided to be 15 .
The only problem that I was living in a small village in Canada , a thousand miles away from the ocean .
I did n't do that .
I @@UNKNOWN@@ my dad , until he finally had a @@UNKNOWN@@ in @@UNKNOWN@@ , New York , which was on the other side of the border where we live .
I made my @@UNKNOWN@@ in a @@UNKNOWN@@ in the middle of the winter in New York , New York .
But the ocean , a real ocean , I had only two years later to face , when we went to California .
And since , in 40 years , the last year , I spent about three million hours under water .
And I learned that the world of the deep , even in the ocean oceans , so rich in @@UNKNOWN@@ lives , as we can actually imagine it .
The imagination of nature does n't know any borders , in contrast to our own , human imagination .
By the way , today , I feel close to the experience of what I see on my face .
And my love for the ocean , with the same level as it and ever .
So when I was a teacher , I was a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That seemed the best way to change my body , to share stories with my need to create images to create images .
When I was a kid , I was constantly thinking .
So the movies of the images , images and stories were connected .
Of course , the stories that I 'm told me from the science fiction -- " @@UNKNOWN@@ , " and " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
I said , " @@UNKNOWN@@ " I could make my @@UNKNOWN@@ for the @@UNKNOWN@@ and the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So , I think my two love .
And something interesting happened in " The @@UNKNOWN@@ : " To create a problem problem in this film , and we had to create a kind of liquid @@UNKNOWN@@ -- we put on a video animation , @@UNKNOWN@@ , back
What it came out was the first computer @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , which ever ever seen in a film .
The film did n't have any money , which was just like he had a lot of his energy , but I realized something fascinating : The audience on the whole world was like @@UNKNOWN@@ from the magic , which
According to Arthur @@UNKNOWN@@ 's third of our engineers and technology is not going to be different from each other .
So they saw something magic .
And I found that exciting .
And I thought , " Wow , that 's really going to be involved in the @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
So we went into " @@UNKNOWN@@ 2 , " next year , a little bit more .
And together with @@UNKNOWN@@ , we made the guy out of liquid metal . And the success of the impact on the effect of this effect .
And it worked again . Again , we created something magic . And the impact in the audience was the same . But we did n't have a little bit more money .
From these two experiences , I had a whole new world , a whole new world of creativity .
So I started a company , with my good friend named @@UNKNOWN@@ , who was at the point of the @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ designer . She was called " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
So the key idea of this company was to do this process with @@UNKNOWN@@ , etc .
So that 's what we did , and we were going to be able to be able to do a long time .
But in the ' 90s , we discovered that we were in the @@UNKNOWN@@ and design design , which we created the company -- we started very slow .
I had this piece of " @@UNKNOWN@@ , " which @@UNKNOWN@@ the sound into the visual effects and @@UNKNOWN@@ effects in the new @@UNKNOWN@@ , but with the human brain , the characters that have been created , and the
But the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ pretty nice . And the people in my company told me that we were not able to be able to do that .
So I did this , and I made this other film about the big ship , the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And I 've got it as " The @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ on a ship , and it became a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , a film .
But I really wanted to make the real change of the invisible ever .
That 's what I did .
That 's the truth . The studio did n't know .
But I convinced them , by saying I said , " We 're going to @@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ . We 're going to make it real .
We 're going to show it in the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the film .
This is extremely important . It 's a good amount of marketing . "
And I invite them to make an expedition .
@@UNKNOWN@@ crazy . But it goes back back to your own imagination .
We created a six months later a reality that I found in a Florida @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , four miles away from the surface of the North , and I was really able to see the real world through a @@UNKNOWN@@
It was n't a film , not a high , that was really real .
So , this really @@UNKNOWN@@ me .
And the @@UNKNOWN@@ were enormous . We had to have cameras and cameras and everything we could do .
And I realized how much these @@UNKNOWN@@ , a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Well , they were also @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And you 're going to go back into this process , then you go into this dark , black environment , where no hope is saving , but if you do n't even back .
And I thought , " Wow , that 's just as if I was in a science fiction . "
That 's really cool . "
I was obsessed with my research .
Anyway , from that part of curiosity and science .
And it was an experience that could n't Hollywood Hollywood .
Because , you know , I could imagine a creature that we could create a visual effect , but I could n't imagine what I could see outside .
In some of the following , I 've seen creatures in @@UNKNOWN@@ , and sometimes things I 've never seen before , and even things I did n't have ever seen before , and for the science of the time
So that 's what I was right and I wanted more .
And so I met another thing .
And after the success of the 1970s , " I said , " Okay , I want to say my job as a magician in Hollywood on ice , and I 'm going to go for a while , a
And then we started thinking , " We @@UNKNOWN@@ " @@UNKNOWN@@ , " and @@UNKNOWN@@ them with @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We went to the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the flag .
We took small robots that we built , a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Our goal was to @@UNKNOWN@@ , and look at the inside of the screen , which never happened before .
Nobody had ever been able to see the inside of the @@UNKNOWN@@ . You did n't have a tool for this , so we developed the technology .
All right now , and I 'm sitting here on the deck of the blind , in a @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I see the @@UNKNOWN@@ here , which looks like this , and I 've seen that once once the
And I 'm playing with a little @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I 'm doing it really , but my mind is within the vehicle .
It felt like I was able to live inside inside the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the Web .
That was the @@UNKNOWN@@ form of a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ that I 've ever experienced before , because before I remember a corner , I knew I 'd always know what 's going on in the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the vehicle ,
And this was a very specific copy of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So this was a very strange experience .
She made me with this experience experience that you 're going to be able to use these @@UNKNOWN@@ and use your mind in the vehicle that can be able to see these different form of existence .
It was really extremely profound .
And maybe also a little look at the thing that maybe in some decades ago , if you have the brain body to study something about , or other things , in all sorts of @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ that I
After this one , we started to see what we saw at the bottom , really , to know , for example , for example , for example , where we looked at these incredible amazing animals -- this is
They live with a lot of help .
They do n't exist in a sunlight where we do .
And so you can see animals that are right next to one of the five degrees below that they can live there .
At the same time , I was also interested in @@UNKNOWN@@ , which was back to the science fiction .
And so I ended up with people who are interested in space , and the people who have to do it , and at the NASA @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and they 're going to go up with Russia , @@UNKNOWN@@
That was fascinating .
But at the end , it would go beyond that I was @@UNKNOWN@@ with the deep .
I took them with them , and they gave them access to the world at the bottom , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , people who were able to find these extreme situations , and I took them to the sources of
We 've moved out of it , but actually actually science science .
So , the circle between my existence as science fiction fiction , when the child , and the more in the reality .
I 've learned a lot of them .
I 've learned a lot of science . But now I think you have to have a leader , you have to be a leader , a leader like a @@UNKNOWN@@ or like that .
But I did n't understand a lot of leadership before I got these @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Because at one point I had to say , " What do I do here ?
Why do I do this ? What 's going to do ? "
These films films do n't make money .
We 're just playing the cost of money .
All of us think I 'm between " invisible " and " My " @@UNKNOWN@@ " and I 've been able to see somewhere in the library on a beach on the beach .
I 've all made these films , these @@UNKNOWN@@ , for a very small audience .
No @@UNKNOWN@@ , no honor , no money . What do you do ?
You 're doing it for the task , to challenge the challenge -- and the ocean is the @@UNKNOWN@@ environment that there are .
Because we did all of that with only 10 to 12 people with 12 years ago , and we 've been working on two to three months ago on sea .
And in this community , you see that the most important thing that you 've got is , is that you have a task that you ca n't tell you .
If you go back to land , and he says , " We had to do it , which is the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and the whole @@UNKNOWN@@ , the whole technology , and the trouble you can
There 's a connection , a lot of respect .
So when I came back to make my next film , " I was trying to make the same leadership , which is that you 're going to be a team , and she 's born with respect .
It became the dynamic .
So , I stood up with a little team on @@UNKNOWN@@ , and we made " @@UNKNOWN@@ , " with a new technology that did n't exist before .
It 's exciting .
A tremendous challenge .
And we 've been taken for a four - million years of a right family .
It changed my way to make films .
There were people who thought that we would have these @@UNKNOWN@@ , and we were really good at the planet .
For me , it was a more kind of a way to do my job , the actual process that changed in the process .
So what can we do ?
What are we learned about ?
I think it 's the curiosity .
It 's the most powerful human quality .
Our imagination is a force that actually can create a reality .
And the @@UNKNOWN@@ of our team is more important than all the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the world .
I 'm going to come to a young lawyer who say , " Give me a advice , as I can do something . "
And I say , " @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
You can do that for you . Do n't do it with yourself , not against yourself . Do n't take risks . "
NASA has such a @@UNKNOWN@@ : " failure is not an alternative . "
But in art , and at the time , you need to have to be an alternative , because there 's a huge investment .
No important thing , innovation innovation , has never been given the risk .
You have to be ready to take risks risks .
That 's the idea that I 'd like to share with you with a failure , and it 's not an alternative , it 's not . Thank you .
Today , I 'm going to talk about energy and climate .
And that seems to be a little bit because it 's my @@UNKNOWN@@ at the foundation , and we 've got to make smart and seeds , to make things that we have to do , and we need to
But energy and climate is extremely important for these people , even more important than any other on the planet .
@@UNKNOWN@@ means that their lives are going to grow over many years , and it 's too much or too much , and the things will change so much how it does n't have their own environment .
That leads to @@UNKNOWN@@ . It leads to us . It leads to @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So , it 's going to change climate change .
And it 's also very important .
The fact is that if you only only get one of the things that would cost the price of the energy of energy .
Now , the @@UNKNOWN@@ is over time .
In fact , the @@UNKNOWN@@ on @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ , industrial industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a @@UNKNOWN@@ case in the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and so we have @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , we can create modern materials and so many things
So we 're in a wonderful situation with power in the rich world .
But if we leave the price -- we 're going to make the price down -- we 're going to meet a new @@UNKNOWN@@ , and we do it with the atmosphere .
CO2 is the CO2 and the equation for CO2 is actually quite clear .
They @@UNKNOWN@@ the carbon CO2 , which leads to @@UNKNOWN@@ , and this @@UNKNOWN@@ has some very negative effects .
Now , the exact context between a @@UNKNOWN@@ and the process of @@UNKNOWN@@ and where the other consequences are there , there are some of them , but not very many .
And there 's sure you can see how bad these consequences are going , but they 're extremely bad .
I asked the top number of times many times , " Do we have to go down down to zero ?
Do n't even half half a quarter ? "
The answer is , until we 're going to go beyond zero , the temperature goes further .
That 's a big challenge .
It 's very different than we say , we have a high - scale truck that 's under a three - bridge bridge .
This has to be very low , on zero .
Now , we do every year , a @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ , about 26 billion tons .
Everyone Americans about 20 tons of people .
In average , it 's about five tons of everyone on the planet .
And somehow , we have to change changes that the zero to zero .
It 's been stopped .
Just a lot of economic change , and it has to control and we have to go from the rise of the rise of the rise to increase , and to a zero to zero .
And this equation has four factors . A little bit of it . They have this thing on the left , on the bottom of the money you want to go from zero , and it 's going to be
So let 's look at a factor , and we think about what we 're going to do with zero .
It probably has to be one of these numbers very close to zero .
Now , that 's fundamental , but we go through it .
First , we have the population .
Today , America billion people .
And it goes down to nine billion people who go to nine billion .
If we succeeded very quickly , we can go up with new @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ , we might be able to measure 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we 're going to see
The second thing is the services we use .
This is all the food that we eat eat , clothing , TV , heat .
These are very good things , and it means that these services are almost almost available on the planet .
It 's great .
In the rich world , in the top of the billion billion , we can do it , and we 're going to be able to do less , but in the average , this number of every year and
So here we see a very basic service . Is it at home , you can read the homework ?
And these students do n't have it , so they go and read their @@UNKNOWN@@ under the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Now , in efficiency , the E , the energy per service , there 's good news .
We have something that does n't happen .
Because of course , in many ways , in other ways , with other @@UNKNOWN@@ , through new ways , in new ways , there are a lot of services in their energy , some of the individual services are
In other people , like the production of @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , or @@UNKNOWN@@ or the @@UNKNOWN@@ or @@UNKNOWN@@ , which has been a lot of more expensive .
In fact , if we 're optimistic , we may have a factor to do a factor or maybe even a factor of six .
But at the first three factors , we 're now about 50 billion of maybe a nine billion billion tons tons , and that 's just not enough .
So let 's look at the fourth factor -- and this will be a key thing -- that 's the amount of CO2 that 's going to be energy .
It turns the question to whether you can get on zero .
If you do coal .
If you do natural gas . No .
Almost every @@UNKNOWN@@ of electricity today , CO2 CO2 , except the energy and energy .
So , what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
We need @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So if I use the term " wonder , I do n't mean the impossible .
The pink is a miracle . It 's a miracle .
The Internet and the service is a miracle .
The people here have been able to have a lot of these ideas .
They do n't have a lot of @@UNKNOWN@@ that you have to wonder a wonder until a certain date .
Instead , you 're just going to be wrong and some other things .
In this case , we need to give up some of the wonder in a short short time .
Now , I wondered , how can I really do that ?
Is there a natural process , a demonstration , the idea of the people here .
And I remember that last year when I met and I loved some people like this .
The idea was really , you know , you know that there are people who live with birds .
For energy , I was here .
I decided that the @@UNKNOWN@@ of my @@UNKNOWN@@ would be @@UNKNOWN@@ to the environment .
So here are a few natural @@UNKNOWN@@ .
You have n't told me that they 're not going to fall down , but they do n't even notice the glass .
Now , there are all kinds of @@UNKNOWN@@ like this , but they do n't all help .
We need solutions , either there or a lot of a thousand - dimensional scale and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and even there are lots of directions where people are looking for , and I really just see five times the
I have @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
These may be able to pay a high school , and if they do better than I 'm going to expect , that 's great , but my @@UNKNOWN@@ here is that we need to be working on all of
Let 's look at the first fossil fossil fuels , coal from coal or coal .
What you 've got to do there , it may be simple , but that 's not it . You do all have to CO2 all the CO2 , which is going to @@UNKNOWN@@ out of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and
There 's some of the research that 's going on a 60 percent 80 percent level level , but it 's going to be 100 percent to get very hard , and an effective for the CO2 of the CO2
Who will make sure ?
Who can get something that is a lot of billions of times more than any kind of waste that you can imagine from other things and other things ?
That 's a lot of energy .
So this is a hard driver .
The next .
It also has three big problems . The cost , especially in the countries countries are high . The question of security is that you do n't really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human practice that
And what do you do with the waste ?
Because although it 's not very big , there 's a lot of thinking .
So three very hard problems that might be , and they 're going to work with them .
The last three of five .
It 's the dark energy , which they 're called .
And also that -- although it 's great , they do n't need a fuel -- they have some of them .
One of the energy energy that produce these technologies are going to increase less than the production of electricity .
These are @@UNKNOWN@@ , you 're talking about a lot of thousands of times more times more than a normal nuclear power .
And also , these things come out .
The sun does n't seem all the day , but it does n't seem every day , and it also does n't wind up the wind .
That 's why you have to get away from this source , a way of energy energy in times when you do n't have available .
So there 's great @@UNKNOWN@@ . There are challenges in the human race , if we say , that the power outside of the country is because you do n't need the technology that you need to deal with the
And there 's the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And to show the dimension , I 've made all of the kinds of batteries that are going to do , look at the cars , computers , computers , cell phones , for everything , and that 's what
So we need a big breakthrough , something that 's going to be a factor of a better 100 than the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That 's not impossible , but it 's not so easy .
That happens when you 're trying to get these @@UNKNOWN@@ sources of saying about 20 percent 30 percent of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
If you want to 100 percent percent , you need an incredible @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Now , where should we go , what is the right approach ?
" A project project " How do we go to the goal ?
What we need is a lot of companies that are working on it .
In each of these five groups we need at least 100 people .
In many people you say , this is crazy . That 's good .
I believe here in the TED group there are lots of people who are there .
Bill @@UNKNOWN@@ has several companies , which is a company called @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ investment in large companies have great things to do interesting and interesting opportunities , and I 'm trying to support that .
So I 'm an experiment , and I 'm going to argue a company , which may be surprising to make the mathematical approach .
There are some innovations in @@UNKNOWN@@ ; @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So the development has been a lot of years ago , so it 's not a great surprise , some of the great ideas .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ idea means that instead of instead of a part of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , one percent , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , we decided to get the 99 percent , the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That 's a pretty crazy idea .
But in fact , you 've been thinking about that long , but you could never be able to be able to predict it , whether it 's going to work , because there 's modern @@UNKNOWN@@ , you can
And because you get this 99 percent , it 's a very much better .
In fact , you can store the waste , and you can even use the waste of these days as @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Instead of looking at the head , you just do it . It 's just a great thing .
So the amount of expensive is going to use a little bit like a light .
You see that it 's a kind of @@UNKNOWN@@ , often as " @@UNKNOWN@@ wave " "
It really makes the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Here 's a picture of an area in Rio .
That 's the waste that 's 99 percent . You 've got the part that 's going to get rid of it , so it @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ of the U.S. for hundreds of years .
And if you get @@UNKNOWN@@ , and it 's easy , you can get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
You know , there 's a lot of challenges , but it 's an example of many hundreds of ideas that we need to go forward .
Let 's think how to measure our success .
How should we look like this ?
Now , let 's go to the goal that we need to do , and then we talk about the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Many people talk about 80 percent of Africa .
It 's really important to get there .
The rest of 20 percent are going to be poor in poor countries , and it 's still going to be something agriculture , and it 's going to be @@UNKNOWN@@ and down to be clean .
So , in order to 80 percent of the countries , the countries , including countries like China , their @@UNKNOWN@@ completely changed .
The other note says , if we use the zero - century technology , whether it 's in all developed countries , and we 're on the way to get the rest .
That 's great important .
That 's going to be a @@UNKNOWN@@ of this @@UNKNOWN@@ .
If we go back from here , what should we see by 2020 ?
It should be both the two elements .
We should use the @@UNKNOWN@@ use to be able to focus on the way down , and the less we 're going to increase the lower , the lower will be the @@UNKNOWN@@ and so much the temperature .
But actually , this note for the things that we do n't need to do this completely , to do the big @@UNKNOWN@@ , just the same , or even something less important than the other ones that have the
Now , these leaders have to follow us , and we can measure it , in @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
There are lots of great books on this issue .
The Al Gore book " We have the choice " and David @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They 're really going to do it through and create a platform that can spread the whole range , because we need to support support from all sides .
There are some who have to come together .
This is a wish .
A very important wish that we make this technology .
If you only give me a wish for the next 50 years , I could choose to the president , a vaccine , and that I love , or I could choose that wish , which is , @@UNKNOWN@@ ,
This has the largest impact .
If we do n't have this wish , the @@UNKNOWN@@ between the long term in the short term of the long - term life , and people think of the bad people , between the U.S. and China , between
So what do we need to do ?
So what do I mean ?
We need to help us more more .
If countries are places in places like @@UNKNOWN@@ , they should not just talk about CO2 .
They should go back to these @@UNKNOWN@@ , and you would be shocked by the @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is going to be able to create these innovative markets .
We need @@UNKNOWN@@ , CO2 emissions , @@UNKNOWN@@ and Johnson , which makes a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We need to spread the message .
We need to start talking about it , and the things that will be done by the government .
It 's an important wish , but I think we can do it .
Thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you very much . Just to understand something better , so that you can imagine an idea of scale investment .
Bill Gates : So , through the simulation of a @@UNKNOWN@@ , all of the great scientists have what we 've done , we need to have a few 10 million , and even if we put our materials in
The hard step is this building the first thing to do another billion , and the @@UNKNOWN@@ and the place that actually actually built the first one .
As soon as the first thing is , when he 's going to do it , it 's all very clear , because the economy , the energy is so different than how we know it .
So , to understand that , that means deep into the ground in the ground , almost like a magnetic neuron , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and then it starts to start the process , and then working on the bottom
BG : Right . Now , you have to go back to the solar system , so there are lots of people and lots of @@UNKNOWN@@ that go wrong , and this thing where you open it , and you
But if you can have a lot of cheap fuel , you can think of him for 60 years -- you think about a @@UNKNOWN@@ -- which you have , without the whole @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And it 's sitting there , and he 's 60 years long , and it 's done .
A @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is a solution for the waste .
BG : Yeah . Now , what happens to the waste : You can sit down -- there 's a lot less waste with this -- -- and take it into it , and it @@UNKNOWN@@ it down .
And we start by taking the waste that 's already in the @@UNKNOWN@@ , or in the @@UNKNOWN@@ or @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is our @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So this is what this system was a problem , which is what we 're going to put in our water , and it 's going to increase the loss of this process .
But while you 're talking with different people in the world today .
Where is the most important interest , what do it really do ?
BG : Well , we do n't have yet on a place , and there 's a lot of interesting @@UNKNOWN@@ for everything that 's called " @@UNKNOWN@@ " in the name , and there 's a lot of people
I 'm optimistic . You know , the French and Japanese have something in the direction .
This is a version of a thing that was done .
That 's a more important step forward , but it 's like a faster and a few countries have built this one , so that every one of them is a quick nervous system , a @@UNKNOWN@@ for our first
In your idea , right and more likely to do something in the life ?
BG : Well , we need one of these @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ things that are very low , we 've 20 20 years , and then 20 years ,
That 's kind of the @@UNKNOWN@@ that we have to show the @@UNKNOWN@@ , which we need to have to do .
And , you know , if it 's fine , and that 's a great wish to make it easy .
And fortunately , there are two years of companies , and we need hundreds of times that the same way that their work work can do for their engineers , for example .
And it would be the best if it could be able to do it , because then you could use a combination .
In the case we need a solution .
@@UNKNOWN@@ the big kinds of leadership , this is the best you know ?
BG : A @@UNKNOWN@@ is the most important thing .
That would n't have it without the @@UNKNOWN@@ , but it makes it much more important .
In the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
You know , we do n't know their work as well as well , but there is the @@UNKNOWN@@ approach , which is another approach .
There 's a sense of @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is something that seems difficult , but maybe the people tell us .
And so there 's different , but the beautiful thing about this is that an @@UNKNOWN@@ has a million times a lot of energy like this , we say , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , and if you can deal with the
If that does n't work what happens ?
Do we have to @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , to try to make the rise of them ?
BG : If you go into this situation , it 's when you have a lot of eating , and you 're a heart attack . What do you do ?
There 's a research that 's called @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is with different techniques to change the warming , so we have 20 or 30 years longer to leave us .
That 's just a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We hope that we do n't need that .
Some people say , you should n't do it at all of the insurance , because one of the things that you can eat is , so you do n't eat it , because you know that one of the
I do n't know if that 's smart , if you 're going to understand the importance of this problem , but there 's now a conversation in @@UNKNOWN@@ about whether you should be able to do that when you
@@UNKNOWN@@ : Do you have one or two sentences for you to convince you ?
BG : Well , unfortunately , the people live in very different camp .
Those , the scientific argument , are very little .
Do they say that there are negative effects that you have to do with the clouds that have changed ?
There are very , very few things that they can tell you that they have a chance in a million .
The problem here is so similar to India .
You make the mistake now , and you pay for a lot later .
And that 's the idea that now , if you all have all sorts of trouble problems in something that you 've got later , and that 's that the investment is not so clear .
The fact is that this causes us to worry .
But my dream here is that if you can do it economic economic , and at the same time , the CO2 is going to say , " The @@UNKNOWN@@ , " I do n't care that it 's not
And that would be the answer to the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ argument that if you use all of this time and energy to use the CO2 to solve the CO2 , all of the other goals , the damage , the
BG : Well , the actual study of the research -- that we should be the U.S. should be 10 billion a year more than we today today -- that 's not so dramatic .
There was no other things .
You 're going to go up with big numbers , and here you can agree with people , if you do something , this is not economic economic , and trying to do that , for me , most of
It 's very short in a @@UNKNOWN@@ , and we 're just going to see the same thing . I think we should need more things that have the potential to be very much cheaper .
If you look at the @@UNKNOWN@@ , you get a very high - @@UNKNOWN@@ , you can only get the rich .
I mean , every one of us here might be five times so much for our energy without our lives .
For the bottom two billion , it 's a disaster .
And even @@UNKNOWN@@ thinks .
His new @@UNKNOWN@@ is now , " Why does n't the research be more popular ? "
He will still be , because of his former stories , with the @@UNKNOWN@@ camp , but he understood that this is a very small group , and that 's why it 's now called the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And this is a @@UNKNOWN@@ that I 'm thinking about .
The research , it 's just crazy .
Bill , I think I 'm going to talk about almost all of that people when I say I 'm really , that your wish is true . Thank you very much .
BG : Thank you .
A few years ago , here at TED , Peter Peter @@UNKNOWN@@ a design competition called " The @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
The idea is pretty simple . The @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ must have to measure the largest structure structure of 20 minutes , about it .
The flag has to be on top .
And , even though it seems really , it 's really hard to do because it 's very hard to work .
And so I thought that this is an interesting idea , and I turned it into a design design .
It was a huge success .
And I 've been about 70 years across the world , with students , designers and architects , even with @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and there 's something about this task , which is deep in the nature of collaboration ,
Instead , most of the people do n't think about the task .
They talk about it , and think of what it looks like , it @@UNKNOWN@@ them .
And then you spend a little time in planning , and organization . You 're going to @@UNKNOWN@@ and what you do .
They 're going to spend a lot of their time in the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the world .
And finally , just before they do n't have a time to take more time , someone gets to the back , and they put it down to the top , take a step back and " @@UNKNOWN@@ -- because
But what 's going on , and it 's going to happen that it 's " @@UNKNOWN@@ " because " A " ooh -- " @@UNKNOWN@@ , because the weight of the @@UNKNOWN@@ is that the whole thing , it
There are a series of people who have a lot more than @@UNKNOWN@@ -- and more than others , and under the high - tech fresh water .
They lie , they @@UNKNOWN@@ them , and they 're confused and really @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And of course , there are also a lot more more powerful than @@UNKNOWN@@ -- and under the best , fresh fresh water .
And this is quite amazing .
Now , why do we do n't make it just by the highest highest , but also the most interesting structures of all .
What are you going to ask ? How is that ? Why ? What ?
And Peter said , " No of the children of the children spend time in your head at the top of your @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They do n't invest in @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But there 's another reason .
And this is that business students were taught to have a real plan , OK .
And he realized .
So what happens when they go to the flag on the top , they have no longer and what happens ?
It 's a crisis .
@@UNKNOWN@@ familiar .
What 's different from the other thing is that they can start with the flag , and our prototype , successful prototype , still with the @@UNKNOWN@@ at the top , so that they can have the ability to use
@@UNKNOWN@@ can recognize this kind of collaboration .
And with each other , the children get feedback feedback , and what does n't do .
So this is the performance , working with our work , the most important way , but we 'll see how different groups .
The average for most of it is about 50 inches of @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ students , half of them , no more , but not a lot , more than the adults .
Who is the most successful ?
architects and engineers .
One is what I saw .
And why ? Because they can see and self - @@UNKNOWN@@ patterns patterns are the key to build structures .
@@UNKNOWN@@ are something about average . But here 's interesting .
If you 're a @@UNKNOWN@@ , it 's going to be able to get more important .
It 's incredible . You can see it and recognize this one team . "
You can predict that . Why is that ?
Because they had the skills of skills .
They lead the process to understand it .
And this team , the water , and the work is going to increase the performance of the team .
@@UNKNOWN@@ skills and @@UNKNOWN@@ and their combination of success .
If you have 10 and a half - old , you 're going to get up about six , the weak structures .
I tried something exciting .
And I thought , let 's make the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So I paid a @@UNKNOWN@@ dollars of software for software .
What do you think about this design students ?
What was the result ?
This happened . Not a team had a complicated structure .
If there 's a four inches of a high - level building , it would have the price to home .
So , it 's not interesting to have a huge impact effect ?
We kept doing this exercise with the same students .
What do you think about ?
Now , I understood the advantage of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That was the same thing , the young team of under the best .
It took the highest building in the highest time .
There are so low - @@UNKNOWN@@ lessons for us to think about nature .
So you might ask , why would anyone actually spend a time - to - a - year - @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
The reason I 'm going to try and create digital tools and processes to create new groups , cars , video games and video games .
And what I 'm going to do is , they 're trying to recognize them all the answers .
Because open , every project has his own grandmother .
The challenge is to create a common experience , a common language , or @@UNKNOWN@@ , the right prototype .
And this is the value of this experience , this simple thing .
And those of you who are interested , can be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's a blog where you see what you 're building .
There 's one step step for step step .
They 're very exciting examples of all the world , like people like the system and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
There 's also @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And the lesson lesson , I think , is that we 're building a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It requires that we all need our senses on the task , and we need to think about our thinking , like our feelings and our actions , in the challenge that we 're present .
And sometimes it 's a little prototype of this experience , which is what it takes us to make us from a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And that can make a big difference .
Thank you very much .
Let 's do that if we have a machine .
A great machine , a cool , TED -- the machine , and it 's a machine .
And everyone in this room needs .
And you can go back to the past , you can go to the future ; you ca n't walk in here and now .
And I wonder what you choose to do , because I asked my friends at last time , and I wanted to ask them all the past .
I do n't know . They wanted to go back before before the cars were or Twitter or Twitter or America .
I do n't know .
I 'm convinced that you 're kind of weird to @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And I understand .
I 'm not part of this group , I have to say .
I do n't want to go back to the past , and that 's not because I 'm a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's because it 's on the planet on the planet , they go forward .
So I want to do this machine , and I want to go into the future .
This is the most exciting time that there has ever been on the planet on this planet , no matter what the scale you scale : health , wealth , mobility , @@UNKNOWN@@ .
There 's never been a time like this .
My grandparents grandparents did n't die when they were 60 .
My grandparents did this number in 70 .
My parents are 80 percent of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So this should be a better at the beginning of my @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But it 's not about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
A kid , which today , in New York , is going to be able to live as long as the oldest man on the world .
Think about it . That 's an incredible fact .
And why is that ?
The smallpox smallpox smallpox .
They have the percentage of the Earth on a way that it has no war ever done .
They 're gone . They 're gone .
We have them .
In the rich world , there are the millions of us that only have a few years ago , even though .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Did anyone ever know what this is ?
@@UNKNOWN@@ , modern medicine , our ability to find billions of people who are successful scientific science .
And from my view , the scientific way of trying to try things out , whether it works , it does n't change if it does n't do that one of the most powerful of humanity .
So that 's the good news .
Unfortunately , this is the whole good news , because there are some other problems , and they were often talking .
And one of them is , despite all of our greatest billion billion people on the world every day to eat hungry .
This number goes up , and it goes very fast , and this is shame .
And not only that we have our imagination to use this world .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ country , @@UNKNOWN@@ , oil , gas , so it 's soon , and if we do n't get out of that chaos -- we disappear .
So the question is : Can we do that ? I think .
I think it 's clear that we can make food , the billion people can eat without without the country that they live with .
I think we can do this world with energy that they do n't break at the same time .
I think that really , and no , this is not an idea .
But this is when I wake up at night -- one of the things I 'm going to night at night , and we 've got scientific science has never done so much like that , yet never .
And we were also able to be able to do it as well as we can do it today .
We 're at the threshold , incredible events in many areas , and yet , I think really , we have hundreds of thousands of thousands of years ago , and then we have to find a time that we
People do n't believe in their faith , and it 's so close that you can not free it .
Not even the truth is free .
And listen , everybody has a right on his opinion , even a right thing to its opinion .
But you know what you do n't have right ?
They have no right to their own facts . ' @@UNKNOWN@@ , you do n't have .
And I took a while to figure out this .
About a decade ago , I wrote an article about " The New York " written , a little article .
And I was surprised to respond to resistance , against the resistance , which is at the end of the most important activity in the health care in the history of humanity .
I did n't know what I 'd do , so I just did what I do and I wrote a paper and I went .
And soon , I wrote a article about a lot of food food .
The same thing , just bigger .
People were crazy .
So I wrote about an article , and I could n't understand why the people thought that would say , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , " and they thought that molecules were able to put together a random way to find a
But you know , I do what I do . I wrote the article I did .
I mean , I 'm a journalist .
We 're doing , we 're going to eat us , that 's okay .
But this article did n't worry , and I could n't find out why , and eventually I found it .
And that 's because this @@UNKNOWN@@ , which were crazy me not at all .
These were @@UNKNOWN@@ people , incredible people , even more people .
They were exactly like the people in this room .
And that brought me up .
But then I thought , you know what we 're honest .
We 're at a point where we do n't have the same relationship for progress .
We talk about it .
We talk about it with little @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
Okay , so there 's reasons , and I think we can know what the reasons are .
We have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes when the science is lost , and there 's no reason why this should n't be .
You can just call a few names and people will understand .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , mass - @@UNKNOWN@@ , the United States .
I mean , you know , you can choose their own list .
There are questions and problems with people who we thought they 'd be right .
Imagine if you ask me , you know .
Take nothing than not .
But now it 's like , if you have to prove this evidence , and you 're not good at it .
And I can tell the reason that we 're now in an epidemic of fear that I 've never seen it , and I do n't see again .
About a 12 years ago , a story published , a terrible story , the autism epidemic with the @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , and @@UNKNOWN@@ vaccine .
Very scary .
@@UNKNOWN@@ studies have been done to see whether it was true .
@@UNKNOWN@@ studies should be done ; it 's a serious issue .
The data came in .
The data came in from the United States , from England , from Sweden , from Sweden , from Canada , and they were all the same , no relationship , no connection , no one .
It does n't make a difference . It does n't make any difference , because we think we think we think what we see what we can see what we do is that we feel .
We do n't believe in a couple of documents of documents , which gives us data , and I understand that I think we all do .
But guess what ?
The result of this was @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In fact , in fact , the United States is one of the only countries in the world , which is going to increase the amount of money .
That 's @@UNKNOWN@@ and we should be worried .
It 's terrible .
What happens is that we could do that .
Now , I understand this . I do .
Because someone else 's got ?
Did a single person in the audience want to listen to someone ?
It 's not very often .
In fact , in this country , not even the world in the last year .
These are a lot of death through 20 , 20 per hour .
But because that 's not happening here , and we can do it in it , and people like @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ can walk around and @@UNKNOWN@@ from fear and @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ like @@UNKNOWN@@ and Larry King @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And they can do it because they cause it , and it does n't connect .
They do n't understand that these things have to be the same thing , but almost never the same thing .
And this is something that we need to learn , and it 's very fast .
This guy was a hero .
He @@UNKNOWN@@ us from one of the worst @@UNKNOWN@@ of humanity .
None of them , no pain , polio .
The guy in the middle .
He 's Paul @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He 's just with a few other people with a @@UNKNOWN@@ vaccine .
He can save life from @@UNKNOWN@@ , 10 children per year in the developing world .
Pretty good , not ?
Now , that 's good , except that Paul @@UNKNOWN@@ and talk about 3,000 people , and say , how valuable they are , and that people would just stop thinking .
And he says this .
Paul is a prediction .
So Paul Paul , in a public group , he ca n't speak without @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He gets calls home , because people like to tell him that they know where their children go to school .
And why ?
I do n't need to say , but we 're essential .
If you take them back , the diseases come back , terrible diseases , and that 's happening .
We 've got now in this country now .
And that 's going to get worse , and pretty soon , children will die because it 's just a question of the numbers .
And they 're not just going to die .
Which is ? How do we do it ? Why not ?
A @@UNKNOWN@@ of me wrote a few weeks ago , and I told them to be a little bit .
Nobody has ever heard before .
It would n't be kid against @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ .
Why ? Because we do n't have a polio . And you know what ?
We had no @@UNKNOWN@@ in this country .
Today , I do n't know , maybe it 's going to go in morning every morning every morning in a airplane , and it 's going to go to Los Angeles , in the moment , he 's over
And in a few hours , it goes up and @@UNKNOWN@@ a car , and he 's going to go to Long Beach , and he 's going to be one of the @@UNKNOWN@@ TED tonight .
And he does n't know that he 's infected with a heart disease , and we do n't know , because that 's the way that the world works .
This is the planet that we live . Do n't do it when it 's not .
We love it with us . We love that .
Do you leave all of your morning ?
@@UNKNOWN@@ , a little @@UNKNOWN@@ that you can do to help you .
I know that you 've done that because half of the Americans do that day .
They take this stuff , and they take an alternative cure , and it does n't make any difference , often often we find out that they 're rational .
The data turns out .
They do what they 're doing .
That 's okay , you want to say about the billion billion dollars for the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I agree with you .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Why do we do that ? Why do we do that ?
Now , I believe I understand the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We hate a great government . We have no trust in the system .
And we should n't do that . Our health system is health .
It 's terrible to millions of people .
It 's absolutely amazing to be cold and @@UNKNOWN@@ itself .
So we 're going to go away , and where do we go ?
We 're running around the arms of the industry industry .
That 's great . I love the @@UNKNOWN@@ industry .
But you know , this is really a serious issue , because this stuff is crap , and we give billions billion dollars .
And I 've got all kinds of little @@UNKNOWN@@ here .
@@UNKNOWN@@ of them -- @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , because I do n't know what this is , but we spend billions of dollars for it .
And you know what ? If I say that , when people say , people say , " What do you want to do ? Let 's people want to do what they want .
That 's how they feel good . "
And you know what ? They have wrong .
Because it does n't matter whether it 's the health health , who says , " Hmm , I 'm going to give the evidence out of my experts , " Do n't find any " or any cancer --
If you 're going to do this way to think of faith and magic and science and science , you get a place where you do n't want to be .
They 're going to get @@UNKNOWN@@ in South Africa .
He brought a lot of his people to do because because he was there , red red , @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ much more than more drugs than we have drugs that we know that they can be able to do
Now , hundreds of thousands of deaths in one country , the worse than any other disease of this disease is going .
Tell me that these things have no consequences .
They have them . They always have .
Now , the @@UNKNOWN@@ epidemic , which we 're right now is that this struggle struggle between the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of food and food .
This is a debate debate . You have to stop .
It 's a debate about words .
That 's not , science .
Everything that we eat , every @@UNKNOWN@@ , every @@UNKNOWN@@ , everybody 's @@UNKNOWN@@ , everybody 's @@UNKNOWN@@ .
You know , there were no @@UNKNOWN@@ in the prison .
There was no @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
There was no @@UNKNOWN@@ . We did this .
We 've done it in the last thousand years .
And some of them did n't work and some of them .
We are @@UNKNOWN@@ , which does n't work .
Now we can do it more , and , of course , there are risks . But we can do something like vitamin A and a half , and the stuff can be able to help millions of people ,
You do n't do that ?
I have to say that I do n't understand .
We also @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Why do we do that ?
Now , what I hear about is that there 's a lot of chemicals , chemicals , complex , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , we do n't want a big fields with a thing that 's wrong .
We do n't want people to train their lives .
We do n't want to have companies .
And you know what my answer is all about this ?
Yeah , you 're right . @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's true , we have a huge @@UNKNOWN@@ , but it 's not science .
It does n't work with science .
It 's right , moral , @@UNKNOWN@@ .
You know that science is not a company .
It 's not a country .
It 's not an idea ; it 's a process .
It 's a process , and sometimes it does n't work , and sometimes not , but the idea that we should not be able to do science , to do their work , because we do n't have a
You know , in the next 50 years , we need to be 70 percent more food than the right now . 70 percent .
This investment in Africa in the last 30 years .
@@UNKNOWN@@ . @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They need that , and we give them not .
And why ? @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We do n't want to encourage people to do this stuff stuff like , for example .
@@UNKNOWN@@ is something that 's a half billion billion people .
It 's about like a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's just a bunch of calories . It 's @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It does n't have nutrients , it does n't have a protein , and scientists do all of it in it .
And then people could eat and would n't be blind .
They would n't go , and you know what ?
That would be nice . It would n't be @@UNKNOWN@@ , but it would be nice .
And everything I can say , why is we fight that ?
I mean , we ask , why do we fight that ?
Because we do n't want to have genes genes .
It 's not about genes genes . It 's not about chemicals .
It 's not about our crazy passion for us , our @@UNKNOWN@@ on food , better food , food food .
It 's not about @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , it 's about people to save lives , and it 's going to lose time to understand what that means .
Because you know what ?
If we do n't do that if we do so , we 're going to argue with something that we feel , I do n't want to be guilty .
There 's no other description for what happened here .
It 's @@UNKNOWN@@ , it 's ugly , it 's not our @@UNKNOWN@@ , and we need to do that .
After this incredible thing , you want to say , " Do you have to be still in that fun machine and in the future ? "
In my case , that 's what I want to do .
At the moment , they 're in the present , but we have an incredible possibility .
We can do this time machine .
We can make them where we want to move them , and we 're going to move them where we want .
We need to have these conversations , and we need to think , but when we go into the brain , and we 're going to be happy to do that .
I know that we can do it , and that 's what I 'm going to do with it , and that 's what I do now .
Thank you .
Thank you .
For some of me , I 'm interested in the way the effect effect , and it seems strange that it seems to be a magician for me , it 's because you 're looking at it as a "
In other words , there 's some of a studies in some studies , which is the consequence effect , and it 's just because the person thinks what happens to her , is a @@UNKNOWN@@ or a kind of
A deception is going to make something more , because someone 's going to hear it .
And so we 're going to understand each other , so I want to show you a quick , very simple magic .
And I 'm going to show you how he works . This is a trick , at least for the 1950s in every @@UNKNOWN@@ for children .
I even @@UNKNOWN@@ him from the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ in the 1970s .
I 'm going to do it for you and explain it .
And then I 'll explain why I explain it .
So , you see what happens .
The knife you can study , my hand you can study .
I 'm going to make the knife just in my foot .
I 'm going to get my back back .
And to make sure I do n't mean anything in my arm , or from it , I 'm just going to make my red right here .
Now , in this way , you can see that it does n't happen at any time , so I can go through , and I do n't have to go up at my feet .
And the goal is very simple .
I 'm going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything 's good , it 's going to make the knife through my physical physical .
It 's actually so hard to see it in the place that I can stop it , without having the knife .
Nothing happened to my top or a little bit of @@UNKNOWN@@ , and you can see everything .
@@UNKNOWN@@ !
Now , this is a trick , which I often often do kids with the magic magic , because you can learn very much more than deception , even though it 's a very simple trick .
You know many of you here in the room of this trick .
He works like this .
I think the knife in my hand .
I say that I 'm going to make my mouth to make sure that I 'm not going to go back to my leg , or that 's a lie .
The reason I 'm going to make my mind is that it 's the secret of the illusion .
In the moment , when I put my hand up with you , so you can see them from the back , moving up here , my fingers , just from where he was in a position where he 's
Right ?
There 's someone who did n't have a childhood .
So he 's here . Right .
And when I change it , changing the fingers .
And now you can talk about why this is a deception , why you do n't hear that the bottom is just three fingers , and it 's not because of the minds and the way that it does n't
But this is actually not here . And then I open my hand .
Of course , it does n't stop there , but not through the @@UNKNOWN@@ of my body , but through a trick , through my @@UNKNOWN@@ , that 's there .
And when I do my hand , the same thing that I 'm going to get through , is through this movement , the finger , again .
I take this hand . And here 's the knife .
This guy can play your friends and neighbors .
Now , what does it have to do with the effect effect ?
A year ago , and I read a study that I really was really right away .
I 'm not a doctor or scientists , and that 's why I was an amazing thing .
It turns out that if you 're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get a @@UNKNOWN@@ in a form of a piece of @@UNKNOWN@@ , in the form of
But if you have the form that you 're going to do that , for example , in a smaller ball , and the blue color and a letter to them , they 're actually more effective .
And that , even though no one of them , they 're just @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But a white ball is not so good like a blue ball .
What ? "
It turns out that it 's not yet .
If you take away , it 's still more than nine than any species .
A number of @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is at the end , and on the other red , it 's better than a white .
It also also works .
A three - year - old day is not so good like three - thirds -- I ca n't just remember the evidence statistics . I 'm sorry .
But the key issue is ...
I also play the role of play .
And the shape matter .
And if you want to get the ultimate resistance effect , you have to put on the needle .
Right ? A @@UNKNOWN@@ with a @@UNKNOWN@@ -- a few @@UNKNOWN@@ of a substance substance that you want to patients with patients .
It creates a very strong image in the head . It 's very much more than a single ball .
This graph is really -- I 'm going to show you a different time when we have a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So the fact is that the white ball does n't work so well as the blue ball , which does n't work so well that it does n't like that , which does n't work so good as the needle
And nothing of all of it really has the quality of it . It 's only our faith in which we have a stronger impact .
I wanted to know if I could use this idea for a trick .
I 'm going to take something that this is a deception , and you 're going to look at it .
We know this one that we have to do with the needle , if it gets to the point .
This is a 18 inches long @@UNKNOWN@@ . It 's very , very @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I 'm going to put it a little bit very little .
This is really my meat . It 's not @@UNKNOWN@@ special meat .
This is my skin . This is not a special deal of Hollywood .
Now , I 'm going to put this needle in my skin , and through them , and through them , they go back to the other side .
If you 're going to make you feel if you 're going to go down , you know , I have a few friends last night in the hotel room , and some people I did n't know , and
So I 'm going to show you if you 're going to be very fast , then you look at the next 30 seconds . Or , you know what I 'm going to do to do the first thing
You can see it right now , but you can also , if you want .
So , it goes , right here , where my meat is going to be on the lower part of my arm , I 'm just going to make a small little bit .
I 'm sorry . Do you crazy crazy ?
And now just a little bit through my skin and on the other hand .
Now we 're actually in the same situation that we had in the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
About .
But now , you do n't want my fingers , right ?
So , I 'm going to show you . This is one , two , three , four , five .
Well , yeah .
I know what people think when they look at it .
They say , " Okay , it 's not so stupid and @@UNKNOWN@@ itself , the skin , just to talk a few minutes . "
Now , I 'm going to show you .
So what does this look like ? Pretty good .
Yeah , I know .
And people say , " Okay . I did n't see that right . "
The people in the @@UNKNOWN@@ come right now .
So let me show you from here .
This is really my skin . This is not a special deal of Hollywood .
That 's my meat , and I can do that .
I 'm sorry . "
People in the back , or the one that later later , you 'll see a video , and say , " Well , that 's what 's going to be a little bit like that , " Well ,
Okay , let me give you a little blood for you .
Yeah , here 's it .
And I normally would love the needle .
I 'd like to put my arm , and show you that there are no @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But I think , in this context , and with the purpose of an illusion , I 'm going to make the needle and put it from the stage .
We 'll go back to the next few days .
I hope you 'll be happy . Thank you very much .
Everyone 's talking about happiness .
I 've got some people who are number of books that are called " @@UNKNOWN@@ " in the last five years , and they gave up about 40 feet , and there were more much more .
There 's a big wave of interest in happiness .
There 's a lot of happiness happiness .
Everyone would like to make people happy .
But despite all of this process of work , there are a lot of cognitive skills that are almost impossible to think of happiness .
And my talk today is mostly part of this cognitive process .
That 's true for me , who think about their own happiness , and it 's true for scientists who are thinking about happiness , because it turns out that we 're just like @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The first of these @@UNKNOWN@@ is a @@UNKNOWN@@ , complexity .
It turns out that the word happiness is just not a useful word more , because we 're using it to lots of different things .
I think there 's a certain meaning that we could do it , but in the big part , and that 's something that we have to give up , and we 're going to have to make the complicated
The second case is an experience of experience and memory , which is basically to be good between his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
And these are two very different concepts , and they 're both @@UNKNOWN@@ in the idea of happiness .
And the third one is the @@UNKNOWN@@ illusion , and that 's the fact that we do n't think about a fact that we need to think about the same thing , without its meaning .
I mean , this is a real cognitive thing .
There 's just no way to get it right .
Now , I 'd like to start with a example of someone who asked a question -- and the answer , after a student , I 'd like to hear a story .
And then he added , really quite emotional , which has changed the whole experience .
But that did n't .
What they had had the memories of experience .
He had the experience .
He had 20 minutes @@UNKNOWN@@ music .
They do n't use it because he was with a memory memory ; the memory was broken , and the memory was everything that he had to do .
What we really say is that we think about us and thinking about other people in the sense of two species of self .
There 's a self - self self that live in the present , and the present is to be able to experience the past again , but it 's basically the present .
It 's the self self , the doctor 's doctor -- you know if the doctor says , " Well , I 'm going to hurt you when I 'm going to @@UNKNOWN@@ you ? "
And then there 's a self - self self , and the self self is that , and the history of our life , is it , and it 's the way that the doctor wants to ask the question
Or " How was your journey for @@UNKNOWN@@ ? "
These are two very different parts , the self self , and the self self , and the two to be part of the most part of the @@UNKNOWN@@ of happiness .
Now , the self self is a storyteller .
And it really starts with a fundamental response to our memories -- it starts immediately .
We do n't tell stories , if we do all of us to tell stories .
Our memory tells us stories , which means what we keep with our experiences is a story .
And let 's start @@UNKNOWN@@ with an example .
There 's an old study .
These are real patients who are going to make a painful .
I 'm not going to go to the detail . It 's not more painful , but it was painful when this study happened in the 1990s .
They were asked to make all 60 seconds of their pain .
And here are two patients . These are their records .
And you 're going to ask people , " Who are more likely ? "
And this is a very simple question .
And B B has clear more of his suffering , and his grandmother was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had a patient , and more .
But now there 's another question : " How many people did that she was suffering ? "
And here 's a surprise .
And the surprise is that the patient 's got a lot of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ that the patient had had a patient .
The stories of @@UNKNOWN@@ were different , and because a very important part of the story is like it .
And not one of these stories is very @@UNKNOWN@@ or great -- but one of them is clear .
But one of them is clearly worse than others .
And the worse was worse when the pain was at the end of his peak . It 's a bad story .
How do we know that ?
Because we asked these people to their @@UNKNOWN@@ , and also a lot later , " How bad the whole thing ? "
And she was much worse than A B B .
Now , this is a direct conflict between the self self and the self self .
For example , the @@UNKNOWN@@ self had B an @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Now , what you can do with a patient , and we actually actually have clinical experiments , and it 's been done , and it works , you could actually actually put the brain from the patient .
That 's going to lead the patient 's suffering , but just a little bit less than before .
And if you do this for a few minutes , you 're going to do that the self - self - @@UNKNOWN@@ experience is a little bit more likely , and you 've got to make that the self -
What 's a story ?
And that 's true for the stories that the memory is , and it 's also true for the stories that we are .
In fact , a story is really , great moments and end .
It 's very , very important and in this case , the end of the end .
Now this is self - life lives .
It took moments of the course of one another .
And you ask , what happens with these moments ?
And the answer is really easy . They 're always lost .
I mean , most of the moments of our life -- and I 've got that -- -- you know , the psychological present , as a three seconds long , which means , you know , it 's a
Most of them are completely different from the self self .
And yet , you get the idea that they count that what happens during that moment of our life .
It 's the limited resource that we use during during the world .
And as we like to use it , it seems to be important , but that 's not the story that the self self self - @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So we have the self self and the self self , and they 're really quite different .
The largest difference between them is the time .
From the view of the self , if you have a dollar , and the second week is so good at the first , it 's the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , as well as @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That does n't work that for the self self .
For example , the @@UNKNOWN@@ self is a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , even better than @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , because there are no new memories .
They have n't changed the story .
And in this way , the most important thing , which is a self - self - of - self - self - @@UNKNOWN@@ self - @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Now , the self self is more than to remember and stories .
It 's actually the one that makes decisions , because if you have a patient who we say , two people in two different groups had to be able to choose what he choose to choose , which is the
The @@UNKNOWN@@ self has no voice in this choice .
In fact , we do n't choose what we choose .
And even if we think about the future , we do n't think about our future .
We think about our future as a memory memories .
And basically , you can look at this , you know , as a leader of the self self , and you can think of the self self - thinking , when one of the self - @@UNKNOWN@@ self -
I 've got the idea that if we 're going to do it , which is very often in the case that we 're going to do with @@UNKNOWN@@ in the service of the self .
And this is a little hard to realize how I think .
I mean , how much we 're talking about our memories ?
This is one of the reasons that for the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the self - @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And when I think about it , I think about a dollar that we 've done in a few years ago in Antarctica , which was clearly the best @@UNKNOWN@@ , which I 've ever had , and I think
And I 've probably heard of my memories about this journey journey , I would say about 25 minutes for the last four years .
Now , if I have ever been able to have the ceiling , I did n't have seen the 2,000 images that I 've had an extra hour .
Now , these are three weeks , and this is a half a half hours .
There seems to be a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Now , I 'm going to be a little extreme , you know , how little @@UNKNOWN@@ I have on the memories of memories , but even if you 're doing more of it , there 's a real question
So I want you to think about a thought .
Imagine that next year , you know that the end of the @@UNKNOWN@@ are all your images , and you 'll get a drug drug that you do n't remember anything .
Now , would you choose the same list ?
And if you choose one another , you can choose a conflict between your two species of self , and you need to think about how to keep this conflict , and that 's not even obvious , because if
Why do we choose what we choose , which is a problem that makes us a choice between the two species of self .
Now , the two species of self - do two things from happiness .
There are actually some of these concepts of happiness that we can use , one of the self .
So you can ask , how happy is that self - awareness ?
And then you ask me , how happy are the moments in the life of self ?
And they 're all -- happiness for a moment is a complicated complicated process .
Which are the emotions that can be measured ?
And , by the way , we 've got a pretty good idea to be lucky to happiness .
If you 're lucky for happiness , it 's a very different thing .
That 's not about what 's happy with a person .
It 's about how happy or happy is the person who think about their lives .
Very different .
Every one of these words is not going to study the most of the most happiness , and I 'm at a lot of scientists at the same thing that have been learning the most of the long - term
The distinction between the happiness and self - @@UNKNOWN@@ of the self is in the last few years , and now you 're trying to measure the two - dimensional .
The top of the World Bank has a global survey that has more than a half million people asked about what they think about their lives and thinking about their experiences . And there were other people in the direction
So in the last few years , we started learning about the best species of self .
And the key lesson that we 've learned is that they 're really different .
You can know how to someone with his life , and this does n't really be much more about how happy he lives and life .
Just to give you a sense of the relationship with the relationship , which is about @@UNKNOWN@@ .
What does that mean when you meet someone and you would tell you , oh , his father is a two - foot man , how much would you know about their size ?
Well , you would see something about his size , but there 's a lot of anger .
They have so much .
When I tell you that someone 's lives with eight eight times on a scale of 10 times , you have a lot of what it 's like happy with his own self .
So the relationship is small .
We know something that happiness happiness happiness .
We know that money is very important , goals are very important .
We know that happiness is mostly to be happy with people who we like to spend time with people who we like .
There 's other joy , but it 's a bit .
So if you 're lucky to be both of the two species of self , you 're going to end up with some very different things .
The conclusion from what I said here is that we should be really lucky to think of a more well - being .
It 's a completely different term .
Now , very short , another reason that we do n't think about happiness is that we do n't look at the same things when we think about life , and when we live .
So if you ask the simple question , as happy people are in California , you do n't get the right answer .
If you ask that question , you think that people are going to be happy to be happy when you say we live in college .
And what happens is when you think about the life in California , think about the difference between California and other places , and this difference is , we 're in climate .
Now , it turns out that climate is very important for the self self , and it 's not even very important for the self self , which is how to be happy .
Now , because that 's self - being self , you can end up -- some people could go back to California .
And it 's kind of like to follow what happens with people who go to California to the hope .
Now , your self self is not going to be happy .
We know that .
But one thing is going to happen . You 're going to think that they 're happy , because when they think about it , it 's like that they 're going to remember how bad the weather was in
It 's very hard to think about well , and I hope I hope to give you a sense of how hard it is .
Thank you .
Thank you . I have a question .
Thank you very much .
Now , when we were just a few weeks ago , I told you that it was quite a very interesting result , which was made by this photograph .
Is that something that you can leave us today , because you have a few minutes left ?
Daniel @@UNKNOWN@@ : Sure .
And I think , the most exciting thing we 've found in the world is a number that we did n't have to do it .
We found this in terms of happiness .
If we looked at how emotions with income income .
And it turns out that under a income of 80 dollars in the year , for Americans , and this is a very large @@UNKNOWN@@ of Americans , about eight , but it 's a great example of @@UNKNOWN@@ at
@@UNKNOWN@@ .
EV : @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ dollars in the people are happy , and they 're going to get less and less than ever .
That 's something that we have absolutely absolutely red line .
I mean , I 've seen that red lines .
Which happens , obviously , is that money is not an experience of happiness , but that lack of money is money , and we can do this very , very clear .
In the senses of the other self , the self self , you get another story .
The more money you make the more productive .
It 's not for emotions .
But Steve , in the entire American , it 's about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
When people take this seriously seriously , I mean , it seems to look at the head , everything we think , for example , in terms of @@UNKNOWN@@ and so forth .
Is there a chance that politicians is that the country seems to find a study like the seriously , and based on politics politics ?
NM : You know , I believe that there 's the evidence of the role of the politics of politics .
The hope will be slowly in the United States , not a question , but in the United States , it 's just happening in other countries .
The people are willing to think that they should be lucky to be thinking about politics .
It 's going to take a while , and people are going to talk about whether they want to experience the happiness happiness , or whether they want to be alive -- and we need to think that we need
As you 're lucky , it 's very different from what you think and whether you think about the self self , or whether you think about the self self .
This is politics politics , I think , in the years .
In the United States , of course , the experience of happiness .
That 's what I think about the next one or two decades of the national statistics .
Now , it seems to me , this issue , or should be at least the most popular political debate for the next few years .
Thank you very much for invention .
Thank you .
I 'm a mathematician - @@UNKNOWN@@ . I design video games .
And I 've been working online for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to make it easy to make the world in the reality that they save in online play .
I 've got a plan for me , and I want to ask more people , including all of them more time with the play and play games .
We have three billion hours a week with online games .
Some of you may think , " This is a whole amount of time for games . "
Maybe something too much time when you think about how many problems we need to solve the real world .
But actually , my research at the Institute for the future , is exactly the opposite .
Three billion hours a week are not nearly enough enough to solve the most problems of the world .
In fact , I believe that if we want to see the next century on this planet , we need to increase this time .
I 've been able to explain that the amount of time spent over 21 billion hours a week .
That seems to be a little bit more @@UNKNOWN@@ , so I can do it with it , if we can solve problems like poverty , global warming , global warming and obesity , I think we need to try
No , I mean it seriously .
Why ? This image looks quite like why I believe that games are so important for the survival of the human species in the future .
This is a photograph of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He wanted to make the feelings of play , so he started playing the players built a camera .
This is one of the classic sound of play .
If you 're not a players , you may have some of the stories in this picture .
And you can probably see this sense of anger , something that fear , but also @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is a very difficult problem .
If you 're playing , you can see some of the @@UNKNOWN@@ here , the top of your eyes and the mouth are a sign of optimism . The @@UNKNOWN@@ are surprise .
This is a player who 's on the edge of a call called @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Oh , you know this . OK . So , so we 've got some players here .
A @@UNKNOWN@@ , a result , which is so positive , that you did n't even know that it was possible .
It was almost beyond the imagination .
And if you do it , you 're shocked to see that you can actually be able to do that . That 's an @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So this player is a short @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And this is what we 're on with millions of @@UNKNOWN@@ on the whole world , when we get the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the future in the future , the face of the @@UNKNOWN@@ of all the @@UNKNOWN@@ on the edge
Well , unfortunately , we look at this face of life in the real life when we 're hard problems .
I 'm going to call it as an " Life , and it 's actually my face , see ? Yeah .
I 'm like I 'm going to live in life .
This is a @@UNKNOWN@@ in my lab at home at California , California , where I was in my @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is why we 're playing better than in real life .
This is a problem that have a lot of players .
We think we 're not really good at play .
And I do n't just less less than even though that .
We 're going to do more with more . I mean , well , I do good at the same thing with the motivation to do something that is inspired with collaboration .
If we 're in a @@UNKNOWN@@ , I believe that many of us are going to be able to make our best version of the time , and even if you 're going to be able to solve the problem
And in reality , if we fail , when we 're in obstacles , we feel often differently .
We feel like us . We feel like us . We feel like us , or depressed .
These feelings do n't play if we play games , play games in play .
And this is what I wanted to study as a student .
Why is it possible to think that you could n't just do anything ?
How can we make these emotions from the play into the reality ?
So I looked at games like the World of @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is the ideal environment for the problem .
And I realized some of the things that I believe in the world 's online in online worlds .
So , first , if you 're in one of these online games , all of the World of @@UNKNOWN@@ , there 's a lot of different characters that are ready to give you a @@UNKNOWN@@ mission , and it
But not just one of our mission , but a mission to do perfect at your current level in the game , right ?
So you do .
They never get a task that you ca n't solve .
But always on the edges of your skills , you have to do it , and you do n't have an @@UNKNOWN@@ in the World War .
You do n't sit around and @@UNKNOWN@@ . It 's always very important to do something important .
And there 's lots of groups .
Where do you go and hundreds of thousands of people who are working with you to work with your history .
We do n't have the same life in such life , so that you can feel that there 's a @@UNKNOWN@@ in @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And also , this story history , this whole story , why we are and what we do .
Then we get this whole positive feedback .
They 've come from " level , " and " @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ " or " @@UNKNOWN@@ intelligence . "
This feedback feedback is not in real life .
If I do n't leave this stage , I 'm not talking about @@UNKNOWN@@ , and crazy crazy idea , crazy crazy idea .
I get into the real life of this feedback .
So , the problem of @@UNKNOWN@@ online -- as the World of @@UNKNOWN@@ , that it 's so @@UNKNOWN@@ , at the end of the edge of a @@UNKNOWN@@ that we 're going to spend our whole time in this
They 're just better than the reality .
Until today , all of the World of the @@UNKNOWN@@ players together have @@UNKNOWN@@ millions of years to create the virtual problems of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That 's not a bad thing .
It may be bad .
But to see it in the context of this : @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ million years ago , we started our first @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So the first person 's eating .
OK , so if we talk about how much we spend time with play , it makes sense of time when you think of the time in terms of scale at the scale of human history .
But also , at it , because it turns out that we 're trying to use this whole time on play , actually change what we are as humans as we can .
We 're going to be able to be able to grow up , very bright .
This is the truth .
If you look at this interesting statistics , recently , a few of the University of University University were published , and the young young person of today in a country with @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ with 10,000 hours - of -
So , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number of two reasons .
First of all , children children in the United States are @@UNKNOWN@@ hours of the moment that they spend in school , from five to high school , high school , when you 're never missing .
So we 've got a full full - year - old thing that young people think about what it means to be a good player , like everything else , what they learn in school .
And maybe some of you may read the new book of @@UNKNOWN@@ , " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
So you see his theory of the success , the theory of the success of the 10,000 hours .
It 's based on the great research of @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is when we spend 10,000 hours with the study of a way that I 'm going to get to 21 21 to age 21 .
We 're going to do so good at what to do , and most of the most people in the world .
So , what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So the big question is , " What are the good players ? "
Because if we could do that , we could n't have done before we 've ever been able to do before the human potential .
So many people we have now in the world , at least at an hour , at least an hour per day .
These are our @@UNKNOWN@@ -- 500 million people , which are quite good in something that 's true .
And in the next decade , we 've got another billion groups that are extremely good in what they 're still .
If you do n't have heard yet .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ , the energy , and energy energy , and working on @@UNKNOWN@@ , instead of the Internet Internet , with all of the world , especially in India , China , Brazil @@UNKNOWN@@ can play .
You expect one another billion players in the next decade .
So we 've got a billion billion dollars .
So I started thinking about what it is , which is what we 're doing to do .
Here 's the four things that I found . The first thing .
OK , imagine how this @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ -- that 's the desire to take something to do something that I think is that we have a psychological hope on success .
@@UNKNOWN@@ always believe that a lot of race is possible , and it 's always worth to try and try it .
@@UNKNOWN@@ do n't sit around .
@@UNKNOWN@@ are proud in the spiders of global social networks .
There 's a lot of interesting research that shows that we like people more than after we played with them , even if they were @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The reason for this is that there 's a lot of trust to play with someone playing a game .
We trust that someone has to spend time with us that the rules are going to be done , we have the same goal , and until we 're going to stay down .
So , that allows the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the network , trust and cooperation .
And as a result of it , we 're also more connected social relationships .
@@UNKNOWN@@ productivity .
You know , there 's a reason why the average word of @@UNKNOWN@@ -- eight hours of hours a week , play as @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The reason is that if we 're playing , we 're actually happy to be hard to work hard than when we do anything or nothing .
We know that we can be as human nature , when we do hard , important work .
And players are always ready to work hard work when they get the right task .
And finally , finally .
@@UNKNOWN@@ love it , part of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Here 's a little bit to see the right light .
The second largest number of the world , with almost @@UNKNOWN@@ , is the World of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Five million people use it a month .
They have more information about the World of @@UNKNOWN@@ in the Internet as an other issue in each other of the other world .
They create a sacred story .
They create a total source of knowledge about the World of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
OK , so these are four million people who are going to end up a single result , which are great -- powerful , individuals individuals .
It 's people who believe that they can think of the world .
And the only problem is that they believe they can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
That 's the problem I 'm trying to solve .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ is a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
His work is great . He shows why people spend so much time , energy and money in online online worlds .
And he says , " We 're going to talk about no less than a @@UNKNOWN@@ in virtual worlds and online online . "
And this from an economist . So , it makes sense .
And he says ...
Not like me -- I design games , I 'm a little bit of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So he says that makes sense to make sense , because players can go online in online worlds in the world .
You can be able to play more with more social connections than our lives in the real life . They get more feedback and reward games in the real life .
So , he says , it 's right now , makes sure that play more time in the virtual world than the real world .
I agree .
But it 's definitely not @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We need to start the real world into a game .
My inspiration comes from an event , which is thousands years .
There are these ancient @@UNKNOWN@@ , from @@UNKNOWN@@ . You know ?
So these fantastic @@UNKNOWN@@ were @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And they were sort of like the first of people developed @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And if you 're familiar with the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the old philosopher @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , you may be familiar with this story . The story about how and why were games .
@@UNKNOWN@@ were @@UNKNOWN@@ , more @@UNKNOWN@@ , in the middle of the birds during the 1960s .
There 's a great idea that the king of @@UNKNOWN@@ came to a crazy idea .
People were suffering .
It was an extreme situation . You needed an extreme solution .
So they invented , @@UNKNOWN@@ loud , and the @@UNKNOWN@@ and a national strategy .
And they would be so very important in the future , where games are so fascinating , and with us with @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ productivity , they would never forget that nothing had to eat .
And then the next day , you would play play . And the next day you eat .
And loud , they 've been 18 18 years out of these birds by eating them a day and eat the next .
The same thing I think we 're going to do today .
We 're playing games , to see the suffering of the real world .
We 're playing a game to do everything that is in the real world , which is all in the real life of life , and we 're going to get what we need to do .
But that does n't have to be the end .
That 's interesting .
And finally , after 18 years ago , the hell was n't going to be successful , so I decided to King the last one last year .
They shared the same in two .
They were playing a @@UNKNOWN@@ , and the @@UNKNOWN@@ were going to be able to make an adventure adventure .
They were @@UNKNOWN@@ , and they were looking for a new home , and they were just so many people who were eating food , and we were looking at the rest of a place where they were able to
That sounds crazy , right ?
But the latest DNA evidence show that the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the later , the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , the same DNA as the old DNA .
And so many scientists came back to the idea that the crazy story is really crazy .
And some of the evidence evidence of a global @@UNKNOWN@@ , which almost almost 20 years , which could explain the past .
So maybe this crazy story .
Maybe they actually have their lives through play , by they were 18 years long in games , and then they had this @@UNKNOWN@@ and so much about how to play together , that they 've created the whole civilization
So , we can .
We 've been playing in 1960 .
That was the first @@UNKNOWN@@ in real time World World of the @@UNKNOWN@@ series .
They were 18 years long ago , we played with six years ago .
I say we 're ready for our own @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So , they sent the half of their civilization on the search for a new world , so I take my third billion billion @@UNKNOWN@@ per week .
We should be @@UNKNOWN@@ that half of us spend an hour a day with play , until we have the problems of the real world .
I know you 're going to ask , " How do we solve problems in the real world in play ? " And exactly what I 've been doing my work in the last few years ?
We have this @@UNKNOWN@@ in our office in @@UNKNOWN@@ , it 's like we should understand the future .
We do n't want to try to tell the future .
What we want to do is the future .
We want to think of the best result , and then people think about this idea in the reality .
We 're going to @@UNKNOWN@@ us across the world , and we give people the opportunities to do it .
I 'm going to show you a little bit three games that I 've designed to try to try to make people live in the future of their own future .
This is " not without oil . "
The game is in 2007 .
It 's a online game where you have to get through an accident .
You know , the @@UNKNOWN@@ is invented , but we 've got enough online content , so it 's for you , and you 're going to live your life life without oil . So , if you go to
We 've done this game with @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in 2007 , and we 've ever seen it over the last three years .
And I can tell you , it was a change experience .
Nobody wants to change life because it 's good for the environment , or because we should be .
But if you 're in a adventure adventure , and I said , " We 're going to oil oil . "
This is an amazing thing that you do .
Just find out how to survive , and most of our players have played the game in the game .
So we 've got to think about the next @@UNKNOWN@@ game , a greater , higher goal , as only as we 've got .
We created the game " @@UNKNOWN@@ " The Institute for the future .
And what 's going to do is the computation of an evidence that the people only have 23 years on the planet .
This @@UNKNOWN@@ is called @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ system .
I call a call to play , which we have almost almost like the " @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
You know the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , where there 's the " The @@UNKNOWN@@ team " -- you have the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the scientists , the former - @@UNKNOWN@@ , and only they can save the world .
But in our game , rather than just five people , say , everyone 's in the @@UNKNOWN@@ team , and it 's our task , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of
And the players were playing the game of eight weeks .
They found 500 incredible creative solutions that you can read , if you 're @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And the last game we get on the top .
If you end up the game , you 'll win from the World Bank , " @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , " 2010 .
We 're working with universities in poverty and @@UNKNOWN@@ them to create social services .
We have a book on this . We have " level high " for @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , sustainability and vision .
I want to invite you to hear this game with young people to share all over the world , especially in @@UNKNOWN@@ , who are able to make their own social social models to save the world .
I 'm going to end up .
I want to ask you .
What do you think what happens next ?
We have all these fantastic players , we have games that we can show what we can do , but we do n't have the real world yet .
Well , I hope that you agree with me that players are human resources that we need to work in the real life , and that games have a great meaning for change .
We have these all kinds of productivity , productivity productivity , the ability to move together , social social networks , @@UNKNOWN@@ -- and the desire for granted .
I 'm really saying that we play together with play games to go on this planet a new century .
And I hope you 're going to play with these games and play .
If I 'm going to go back to the next decade , I 'm at two things that we can create each other future , and we can make all kinds of games .
So I say , let 's play the games games .
Thank you .
I 'd like to tell you something a little bit of a few months ago writing a book for @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I 've been writing my writing book -- but I was with the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the text , and I realized that I never had ever in my life , which is the word " @@UNKNOWN@@ "
I read this one .
" @@UNKNOWN@@ , " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
@@UNKNOWN@@ : @@UNKNOWN@@ , strong , powerful . "
I 've read this list of a friend , and she did n't laugh , and it was so ridiculous , but I just came up to " @@UNKNOWN@@ , " and I could n't have to read more and
Of course , this was a @@UNKNOWN@@ , old @@UNKNOWN@@ -- I was just thinking that the last has been quite old .
But in fact , it was a @@UNKNOWN@@ on the early ' 80s when I started working with school school , and I began to see my self - looking at my home and building it in other ways and
And God , thank you , I did n't have a dictionary dictionary .
If I 'm going to take this seriously seriously , I was born in a world that someone might feel like me as a person in their lives in life , so that I 'm going to think for the
So I decided to take online online @@UNKNOWN@@ from 2009 , and I 'll expect that I 'm going to give you a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Here 's the @@UNKNOWN@@ version of this @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Unfortunately , it 's not much better .
In particular , I 've been able to say the last two words in " @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ " " and " healthy . "
But it 's not just about words .
It 's about what we think about the people that we describe with these words .
It 's about the values that are in these words , and how we create these values .
Our language is thinking about how we think about the world and the people around us .
A lot of other societies societies , including the Greeks and the @@UNKNOWN@@ , who really believed that the @@UNKNOWN@@ of a @@UNKNOWN@@ has a great force , because what you can see , you can also see .
So , what do we really want to do ? How a human people or a powerful people ?
In fact , a lot of people think about people as a kid , who might be able to @@UNKNOWN@@ them , and they have ideas .
Would n't it be nice to show you open ?
A person who was open to me , was my director at the @@UNKNOWN@@ Institute at @@UNKNOWN@@ Institute in @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He 's Dr. @@UNKNOWN@@ . A @@UNKNOWN@@ - Americans , the name , as you can think , most of the Americans were not correct , so he was called Dr. Dr. @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And Dr. @@UNKNOWN@@ was very @@UNKNOWN@@ and flies for the work with children .
I found the time I 've been working in this hospital , just great -- until I 'm going to @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I had to be able to study that many times more with these @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ -- in different colors -- that you know , my arm -- muscle , and I 've got these @@UNKNOWN@@ more than I
And imagine what I 've even been thinking about as a kid with Dr. @@UNKNOWN@@ , and so trying to do this exercise , without @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And one day , he looked at me at one of my studies -- these memory were just @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ -- and he said to me , " Wow , thank you , so you 're a strong ,
And if you do it , I 'll give you a hundred hundred dollars . "
And that , of course , just a simple trick of Dr. @@UNKNOWN@@ , so that I do n't do what I do n't want to do , with the @@UNKNOWN@@ , five - year - old girl in the
And I wonder today , how much of his vision of me as a strong and young young young girl , I also built my way , and I could imagine myself as a natural nature , and how to
This is just one example of many , like adults in the @@UNKNOWN@@ of a child .
But as the last example , the examples of what we 're going to do is to prove our language , we do n't think of our language , we want to imagine something that we all would like to
Our language tells the social changes that in many cases in a few cases through a change .
From the medical point of view , you ca n't say that my legs , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ for @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ from Mars and artificial @@UNKNOWN@@ for the body that allow people to really allow all of
So maybe it 's going to change this technological change , because the fact that it has always been a different truth , which is that every person is going to be able to find something very @@UNKNOWN@@ and very
The human ability to think about this is an interesting story , because people always ask me to talk about how I deal with it , and I 'm going to tell you something that this sentence has never been
This sentence from the way of living with life from the idea that success or happiness is to have a challenge to @@UNKNOWN@@ without the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the experience , as if my life was so successful , because I
But the truth is that we 're changing . Of course we do n't think about the challenge , whether it 's perfect , emotional or even more .
And I argue that it 's good .
@@UNKNOWN@@ are not a threshold that we need to have to be able to understand our lives better .
@@UNKNOWN@@ are just in our lives .
And I tend to see how much more than my shadow .
Sometimes I realize that it 's very hard to see , sometimes it 's hard to see , but it 's constantly at me .
And I do n't want to change the impact or the most of the human @@UNKNOWN@@ of a human being .
There 's a lot of life , and challenges , and these are just real real life , and every person is so different . But the question is not whether we do n't know about it , or not
So we 're not just responsible for the people that we love , and @@UNKNOWN@@ them , but they also need to be able to do it well .
And we do n't give our kids to us , if we give them the sense that they ca n't adapt .
You have to do two things : I 'm going to give you the medical fact that it is to be @@UNKNOWN@@ , and the other thing that I think is whether I 'm not happy or not .
And to be honest , the only real life , and I believe that I 've got to break apart , that is the world that I think I can call it with me .
In our wish , to protect people who protect us in the heart , and they do the cold , hard truth about their medical government , or even to give a change to the quality of life that they
Maybe this is the concept concept that only just look at what 's in a broken system , and how do we fix it for every single greater than the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
If we do n't have a human beings , and not all of all of its forces and possibilities , and we 're able to do it in the natural fight , and they may have to be able to
We @@UNKNOWN@@ a human society for our society .
So we have to focus on the @@UNKNOWN@@ and look at all of the human opportunities .
But the most important thing is that it 's between the perception of our imagination and our great imagination , a connection .
We should n't be able to realize that hard times , or not , we should n't be able to be able to do n't try to avoid it , but we should be able to lose them from the
I 'm going to think about it , so clearly we do n't have to be able to do it , but that we 're open to open them , they 're going to be able to do it with
And maybe we can do it as a natural process , natural and useful and feel ourselves through the presence of the presence more like that .
In this year , we celebrate the last birthday of Charles Darwin , and he wrote about 150 years ago with evolution , Darwin Darwin , in my eyes , in something very unusual in the human character .
I would n't do it that way , not the most of his kind of his way , and also not the @@UNKNOWN@@ of his kind , but it that can change the best way .
@@UNKNOWN@@ conflict .
Not just as Darwin 's work , we know that the ability of the person to survive and @@UNKNOWN@@ , from the fight of the human mind .
So again , again and change is the greatest skills of human beings .
And maybe we do n't know what we 're going to do , which is when we 're really going to test it .
Now , this is exactly the point of meaning , a sense of self - @@UNKNOWN@@ , a sense of our own power .
We can give us something more .
We can give up a new meaning , the hard times .
Maybe we can see more than change .
@@UNKNOWN@@ are a change that we do n't have yet .
I think the largest damage we have in our own world is to believe that we should be normal .
For example , who 's normal ?
There 's no normal .
There 's the bad thing . The @@UNKNOWN@@ . But not the usual thing , and would you see that poor , dark person , you know , if they were really ?
I do n't think more .
It would be great if we think of this paradigm of climate change against the other , or the strength , even even to be a little bit more likely to be able to be able to be able to
@@UNKNOWN@@ have found that we have people from the members of our society always have to be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
There 's some evidence that the hundred years ago ago , older people have been killed with people who were able to hurt pain in pain , and that happened , because the experience in the fight of the human
They did n't look at these people when they did , and they did n't find something or something special .
A few years ago , I went to the city , which I grew up in a @@UNKNOWN@@ in the Red park in the south of Pennsylvania , and I was standing there with a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It was summer and I had @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And I hear , like a guy behind me , " Well , if you do n't do it . "
And I 'm looking at me and see this older man . I had no idea who he is .
And I said , " Sorry , sir , do we know ? I ca n't remember you . "
And he said , " Well , you may not remember me .
When I looked at the first time , I took her back from your gut . "
So , oh .
And of course , it did n't click .
This was Dr. @@UNKNOWN@@ , a man who I just just learned from my mother on this day , because I was , very typical , to my first two weeks .
The doctor for @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of my mother was in the morning , and so my dad had the man who brought me into the world at all .
And because I was born with no @@UNKNOWN@@ , and my feet , and they were just a few toes on this and a little toes on the other foot , and he had the @@UNKNOWN@@ , that stranger had
He told me , " I had to give her parents to say that you 're never going to go , and never would be able to be able to give your other children or you could never have a
Really , I found that he had @@UNKNOWN@@ my entire childhood childhood , but if I had a @@UNKNOWN@@ competition in the second class , if I did with the @@UNKNOWN@@ at the @@UNKNOWN@@ at the @@UNKNOWN@@ , I was
And he called this part of his top of the X factor , the potential of human potential .
You ca n't just enough enough to how much of this factor for the quality of human life .
And Dr. @@UNKNOWN@@ said , " he said , " I learned that children when they do n't get something else , and even if they only get a little help , if you can children children even better ,
Look , Dr. Dr. changed .
He had the understanding of the medical medical , and how someone can make two different things .
And also , I think , in the course of the time , when they started when I was at the age of 15 years ago , if I could have my physical @@UNKNOWN@@ on legs , and I had
I wanted to be normal .
If you ask me today , I 'm not sure that .
And this is what I 've seen with my legs , and I do n't have some of these experiences .
And maybe I could do that change , because I 'm so many people who I have opened open , rather than people to face me , or the idea of an idea .
Look at it , it really takes a people who you can tell you , how do you create your forces , and you 're through .
If you 're going to give it someone to your own , virtual power , the human mind is so @@UNKNOWN@@ -- if you can do that , and for someone in a moment moment a door , you 're
They bring them to open itself .
The real meaning of the word " @@UNKNOWN@@ " in the word " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
It means something that is in a potential , the potential potential .
Again , what potential do we want to do now ?
In the ' 60s , in Britain , a few years ago , the @@UNKNOWN@@ were @@UNKNOWN@@ in @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They call it the " @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ " in the United States , when we call it "
The students will be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And the A student are going to get harder harder than the better teachers and so forth .
And you 've got a lot of years ago with a " @@UNKNOWN@@ " The @@UNKNOWN@@ , " and she told them , they were @@UNKNOWN@@ , that they were very smart . And after these three months , they
And of course , of course , it would like to hear the heart that the @@UNKNOWN@@ students were told that they were only enough .
And it was then after three months .
But only those who were still in high school -- except from the students who had high school .
It was critical to this study that the teachers were not @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The teachers did n't know that something changed .
They were just told that the students are students -- and the students have students with the note , and they also taught them something , and they treat them .
The only real potential is a self - spirit mind , and it did n't have a hope that has no hope . He does n't find more beautiful . It 's missing our natural natural feedback , and our
If we 're going to do it with the human mind , to continue to hope , and other people around us are beautiful to be curious , and we 're going to be able to make our forces really
If there 's a spirit about these properties , we can create a new reality and new @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I want to end with a poem , which is by a @@UNKNOWN@@ named @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in the 14 century .
Come up with me . Thank you very much .
How would you be better than you 're right now ?
So , I said that there were a few genes of your genes , a better memory , or more quickly .
Or you want to be more powerful , more powerful .
Do you want to be more and more optimistic ?
How would it be longer for good health ?
Or maybe you are one of the people who are still more than creativity .
Which would you like most of them ?
Which would you like if you could just have one ?
creativity .
How many people would choose creativity ?
Please raise your hands . Let me see .
Some of them .
That 's very good .
How many would be good for a good memory ?
Just a few more .
How about it ?
A few less .
What about longevity ?
Ah , the majority . I @@UNKNOWN@@ like a doctor .
If you only have one of them , it would be a very different world .
Is it all that way ?
Or is it possible ?
The evolution is a kind of talk about the TED conference , but today I want to tell you the idea of a doctor .
The great @@UNKNOWN@@ in the 20th century , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , which was a @@UNKNOWN@@ in the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ church , who wrote a piece of paper , which has n't seen anything in biology .
Now , if you 're one of those who do n't look at the evidence of the biological evolution , that would be a very good time , your @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , take your personal @@UNKNOWN@@ -- I 'll give
But if you think of evolution , if you remember this , it 's just about the past , or is the future ?
Is it for others or not it ?
This is another look at the tree of life .
In this picture , I 've got a bush as a center of the @@UNKNOWN@@ in all directions , because if you look at the south of the tree of life , all of the surface of the surface of
The human part of this @@UNKNOWN@@ , is the end , of course , which we 're most interested in .
We went from a common ancestors with modern chimpanzees , about six or eight million years ago .
In this period , maybe maybe 20 or 20 different species of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Some of them came up .
We 've been here for about @@UNKNOWN@@ years .
It seems like that we 're right away from the other parts of the tree of the life , but actually the most part of the parts of our parts of our cells are right .
Is you sure that we can take out of it , and the @@UNKNOWN@@ of a common molecule can make the protein of protein to produce the protein of the protein that is used to treat the brain ?
This is not like @@UNKNOWN@@ ; this is the same protein that is @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of what that comes from .
And what we 're talking about bacteria is that you know that each of us in our gut are more bacteria than the cells in the rest of our body ?
Perhaps 10 times .
I mean , think , if I think , if you ask yourself , if you ask yourself , what do you think about the bacteria ?
Our gut is a wonderful @@UNKNOWN@@ environment for this bacteria .
It 's warm , it 's dark , it 's very @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And you 're going to get all of them nutrients that they could just be able to do without effort .
It 's really a lighter easier for bacteria , with @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But yet , you 're a wonderful environment for these bacteria , as they 're important for your life .
They help us from the @@UNKNOWN@@ of nutrients . And they protect against diseases .
But what will happen in the future ?
Are we in a kind of balance balance in a species ?
Or are we going to be something that might be something that might even be better at the environment ?
Now , let 's take a step back to the time of the Big 11 billion years ago -- the Earth , the solar system , about a billion billion years ago , the first of these things , maybe
In this vast majority of the universe , the life of life on the Earth is just a long time ; the animal animal , like a @@UNKNOWN@@ , and the human life , a little @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We were .
This also also the @@UNKNOWN@@ of this talk , so I hope that I 'd like to eat it .
Now , when I was a @@UNKNOWN@@ on college , I was my first @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I was fascinated by the beauty and beauty of biology .
I grew up in the power of evolution , and I found something very important , and most of the existence of life in @@UNKNOWN@@ organisms , @@UNKNOWN@@ each cell , and all of the genetic information of the cell
But at the time when it grew organisms , they started changing things .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And really important , with the analogy of sexual sexual , which is the genome genome , which is the rest of the body .
In fact , you can say that the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the body of our body in the evolution of the same moment as the sexual population .
Now I have to say , when I was a college student , I thought , okay , sex , death is a death death , death for sex -- it seemed pretty much more successful at the time ,
And I came up with the feelings of George George , who 's been in Lebanon , his show in the 90s .
And one night , this is a @@UNKNOWN@@ of his @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He opened the door .
He told a beautiful @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
She 's looking at him and says , " I 'm here for Great sex . "
" This is wonderful , " George says , " I 'm going to take the soup . "
I came to the realization as a doctor that I was going to be a goal that was different as the goal of evolution .
I tried to make the body .
I wanted to keep healthy .
I wanted to health health for a disease .
I wanted to make a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the genome to the next generation , @@UNKNOWN@@ and generation generation .
From an idea of view , you 're developing , and I like @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , to get the genetic genetic data into the next stage of the orbit , to get into the ocean .
And I think we would all want to change the spirit , the leader , who has to predict the phrase , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , " when he said , " I do n't want to make my life through
I do n't want to die .
evolution does n't mean the life of living life .
It does n't necessarily @@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ or the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and not even the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
evolution like the creatures that are very best in your environment .
It 's just the test of survival and success .
On the bottom of the ocean , there are bacteria that are @@UNKNOWN@@ , and they 're going to die because they 're going to be killed , but fish fish were going to be able to eat it ,
So , what does this mean when we look at what happens in the evolution , and how do we think about the space of people in the evolution , and how do we look at the next stage ,
The first is that we 're not going to go .
We have a kind of balance .
And the reasons that it could n't be done by medicine , we 've been able to get a lot of genes that would have been @@UNKNOWN@@ , and from the population .
And second , we have a species that we have in our environment so that we 've done it that they can adapt to us as well as we adapt .
And by the way , we go down , and we 're going to tell us so much that you ca n't say that it 's necessary to be necessary for evolution .
A second possibility is that it 's a evolution of traditional evolution , of course , from the natural nature .
And the argument , this would be the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the evolution , but they 're also @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And so far , the truth is , if we 're looking for a species of the planet planet , it 's going to be @@UNKNOWN@@ and the changes of the environment that evolution can produce evolution .
But there 's a third possibility , an amazing , fascinating and exciting possibility .
I call it the evolution of the evolution of the new development that 's not just natural , but led to us as individuals as we do .
Now , how could that happen ?
How could it be possible to do this ?
Let 's look at the reality that people have today , in some cultures of different decisions about their dreams .
They are , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
It 's not really good for society , but it 's what the individuals and the family decide .
So think about if it 's not only possible to be the gender of your child , but also , you can see the same genetic disease that causes diseases , and prevent it .
What if you could get the genetic changes in terms of diabetes or Alzheimer 's disease or the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the brain , or resistance ?
Would n't you want to change these changes in your genes ?
If we 're going to be able to change these kinds of changes .
The digital Project started in the year , and it took 13 years .
It cost nine billion dollars .
In the next year , when it was in 2004 , we could do the same thing for 20 million dollars on four months .
Today , you can see a sequence of the three billion points of the human genome at a price of about $ 20,000 dollars in the room of about a week .
It 's not going to be a long time until the reality is going to be a thousand dollars of human genome , and it 's going to be increasingly available for everyone .
A week ago , a @@UNKNOWN@@ of the National National Institute of engineering at the University of the 19th - century @@UNKNOWN@@ of San @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , two scientists , the independent developed developed that developed the natural
A few years ago , the @@UNKNOWN@@ price of the scientist @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ for his research in the study of an adult @@UNKNOWN@@ , a @@UNKNOWN@@ , and through the @@UNKNOWN@@ of only four genes , the cell to
These changes are coming in .
The same technology that makes the human resistance in bacteria that can not make viruses that do n't just protect protection , but also to prevent the other viruses .
Whether you do n't believe it or not , it 's an actual study in the way that we 're going to prevent against malaria in the gene in the cells of a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Can you imagine something that 's coming from ?
This is all reality and in the future will be much more possible .
Imagine just two other little things .
You can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells ?
What if you put the @@UNKNOWN@@ and eggs or the fresh @@UNKNOWN@@ , to give your kids to a better chance for a @@UNKNOWN@@ - life life -- to diabetes , diabetes , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the risk of cancer
Who does n't want to make children ?
And then the technology of technology , the same engine of science can change the changes that can change the disease , to prevent disease that could allow us to be able to make sure -- @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ --
Why do n't have the @@UNKNOWN@@ of a Ken @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , especially if you can fold it up with the next generation of Watson ?
Why do n't you have the quick @@UNKNOWN@@ that you have to be able to get faster and less ?
Why do n't live longer ?
These will be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And if we 're at a point where we can go to the next generation generation , and we can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to create the
We 're going to have a process that can be about 100,000 years , and we can fly it into a thousand years -- and maybe even on the next 100 years .
These are decisions with our grandchildren , or their grandchildren , are going to be able to go .
Let 's make these decisions a society which is better , which is more successful , which is more common ?
Or are we going to be able to be able to create different societies that we want for some of us , and not for others ?
Are we going to create a society , and it 's @@UNKNOWN@@ , or more and more complicated ?
These are the kinds of questions that we have to face .
And most of all , are we ever going to be able to understand the wisdom , and the wisdom we need to be able to make these decisions ?
In the good case of bad guys , and maybe as you might think , these decisions are going to us .
Thank you .
I want you to imagine something that is a robot robot to give you the skills of skills , or another others who will be able to go back and down .
We 've called this robot at @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's nothing more than something that you 're going to do in the morning , and that you give me an X - ray , and that your speed will continue to increase , and you 'll help you
This is actually true true of human and machine .
But not only do that -- and together , you connect with the universe and other computers .
It 's not just a crazy idea .
Now , to show you what we 're working with , we start to talk about the American soldiers , in the average of about 100 pounds on his back , and it 's the evidence that they need to
Of course , this leads to some of the challenges -- @@UNKNOWN@@ , 30 percent of them -- @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So we thought that we would take us this challenge , and we wanted to create a @@UNKNOWN@@ that would help us with this problem .
So let me tell you today , or the human - @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ : With the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , I can put 200 pounds of @@UNKNOWN@@ over - a - time - hour - long - time surface , lots of hours .
His design design is to allow us to deep deep , and moving through the movements of movements .
It feels what I want to do , where I want to go up , and I get my strength and resilience .
We 're here , with our @@UNKNOWN@@ of this device , this new @@UNKNOWN@@ in this year .
So it 's true .
So let 's look at our look at the world , something that I 'm really excited about today .
There 's a million million people around the world in the world .
That 's about one percent of the population .
And this is actually an example .
We 're going to talk about very young people with @@UNKNOWN@@ , who are in the @@UNKNOWN@@ of their life -- @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ -- the destiny , and the wheelchair is the only option .
But it 's also about the population population , their number .
And that 's the same option -- if it 's about a @@UNKNOWN@@ , or the other way -- it 's the wheelchair .
And this is , by the way , 500 years , since his way , I have to be very successful .
So we thought that we could start with a completely new chapter in the scale .
Now , let me tell you , now , from the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , who had been killed by the 19th century , which was a result that you did n't have been going to walk over
Thank you very much .
So , as I said , Mr. @@UNKNOWN@@ our @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It has sensors .
He completely changed the @@UNKNOWN@@ of sensors in the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the signals that we 're using on our @@UNKNOWN@@ computers , which is on her back on their back .
So here are also @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is @@UNKNOWN@@ on their own , and as well as they go to their @@UNKNOWN@@ , they 're moving forward in this pretty @@UNKNOWN@@ and very natural natural process .
I was 24 years old , and in @@UNKNOWN@@ , when a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ during a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In the part of a second , I lost all of my feeling and every movement of my @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Not long after a doctor in my @@UNKNOWN@@ , and he said , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , you 'll never go back . "
And that was 19 years ago .
He @@UNKNOWN@@ every hope of my mind .
@@UNKNOWN@@ technologies have been taught me to learn to learn again , again , again , and they drive up with their hands .
But it was n't invented , and then let me go back .
Thank you very much .
As you can see , we have the technology we 've got to have the @@UNKNOWN@@ to meet us and with you .
It 's in our hands , and we have the whole potential to change the lives of future generations -- not only for the soldiers , or for @@UNKNOWN@@ , and all of them , but for everyone .
Thank you very much .
At home in New York , I 'm the leader of the @@UNKNOWN@@ of an organization organization called @@UNKNOWN@@ .
If I do n't have the poverty poverty , I 'm a @@UNKNOWN@@ of a fire fire in a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ fire .
Now , in our city , in the volunteers , a group of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , you have to be very early on the @@UNKNOWN@@ to be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I remember my first fire .
I was the second group of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I had a good opportunity to make it .
But it was still a @@UNKNOWN@@ against the other volunteers to get the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and find what our tasks would be .
When I found the @@UNKNOWN@@ , he had just a very serious conversation with the @@UNKNOWN@@ , who certainly had the worst days of her life .
It was in the middle of the night , and she stood up in front of them , and you see under a screen outside in the rain rain , during her house in fire .
The other volunteers that I 've been asked about -- -- we call him @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ -- the @@UNKNOWN@@ as the first , and asked them to go back to the house and the dog of the dog .
The dog ! I was lost .
There was a lawyer or a lawyer , who 's going to work for the rest of his life that people could tell us that he was in a house house to save a living , because it was five
Well , I was the next .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ me .
He said , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , you have to go into your house . "
You have to go up and go on the fire , and there 's a couple of shoes . "
I promise it .
Now , I did n't exactly exactly what I 'd like to do , but I was going to go down -- the @@UNKNOWN@@ high , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ , " at the end of the time
I know what you 're thinking , but I 'm not a hero .
I was wearing my head back to the point where I put up on the front of my home and the loved dog .
We put our @@UNKNOWN@@ out out of the idea where , not surprising , some of the more attention than my attention .
Some weeks later , the @@UNKNOWN@@ gave a letter of the letter , which she was for the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ of their house .
One of the most importantly , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , someone had a pair of shoes .
Now , both of my job in @@UNKNOWN@@ , as well as I 'm in my @@UNKNOWN@@ as a @@UNKNOWN@@ , I 'm @@UNKNOWN@@ by @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ in the big scale , but I see also the collective and
And you know what I learned ?
They 're all important .
So if I look at this room , and people see that you can have a success success , or on their own way , I want to try to show you this moment , wait .
Wait that you can make a difference in life with another person , you 've got your first million .
If you give something , you 'll give it now .
@@UNKNOWN@@ it in a @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ a park in the neighborhood .
They were a proud .
Not every day we will give us a chance to save the lives of a human , but every day we can change the possibility to change one .
So go ahead ; you save the shoes .
Thank you very much .
Bruno Giussani : Mark , Mark , come back .
Thank you very much .
I 'm just coming from a community which has the secret of the human history .
It 's a place where women are going to lead to the women , with sex , they say , and the game play the day -- which is a serious issue .
And no , it 's not @@UNKNOWN@@ , or San Francisco .
Ladies and gentlemen , your relationships .
This is the world of the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the Congo .
@@UNKNOWN@@ are together with chimpanzees .
That means we have a common ancestors , an evolutionary grandmother , which was about six million years ago .
Now , chimpanzees are known for their @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But unfortunately , we have this aspect of @@UNKNOWN@@ in the history of human evolution .
But the fact show us the other side of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In the way of chimpanzees , by @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , people are going to see the oldest society of @@UNKNOWN@@ female .
They have made it up , because this leads to a very @@UNKNOWN@@ society , in the violence violence has n't seen .
But unfortunately , those are the most popular known as the animal .
They live in the middle of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and they 're very difficult to open .
The Congo is a paradox -- a country of biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the dark itself -- the @@UNKNOWN@@ of a common conflict that has been known for decades , and almost so many lives
It 's not surprised that these destruction also have the survival of survival .
@@UNKNOWN@@ and the @@UNKNOWN@@ of climate change that you do n't even have a @@UNKNOWN@@ with the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and even if we 're not sure to be honest .
And yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a laugh laugh that trees trees .
Who are these happy ?
We know them as " love instead of @@UNKNOWN@@ , because they have @@UNKNOWN@@ , also sex sex with @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and @@UNKNOWN@@ it as social and social @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I do n't say that would be the answer to all sorts of problems -- because the life of the @@UNKNOWN@@ is more than the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ -- like people -- love love to play their lives .
@@UNKNOWN@@ does n't matter .
For us , and it 's play for the social relationships between relationships and the health care .
And we learn and trust the rules of the game .
@@UNKNOWN@@ and creativity and resilience , and it 's all about the diversity of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity in terms of diversity .
And if you look at the game , you can look at the popular evolution of human beings , @@UNKNOWN@@ and rituals .
@@UNKNOWN@@ is the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Well , I do n't know how to play , but I want to show you a few images of the wild .
First of all , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So here we see a young female and male in a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Look at what it does .
That might be the idea of what he said , " You put him in the eggs . "
Just I think it does n't like it , right .
Yeah !
So @@UNKNOWN@@ are @@UNKNOWN@@ , both of the same as people .
And this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the @@UNKNOWN@@ , where you create new elements in the same way -- like the @@UNKNOWN@@ -- and also
But the game is a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ is a @@UNKNOWN@@ , and it can be a lot of shapes that some of them are a little @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , curious -- maybe to discover it again .
And I want to show you , this is @@UNKNOWN@@ , a young female , and she plays with water .
I think exactly how do we play it , and we 're going to move our limitations and our worlds and virtual worlds .
And it 's a little bit of curiosity that we 're going to explore , and we 're looking at the way that we are , which are the real water of creativity .
This is just a little bit of the @@UNKNOWN@@ that we have in our past and present .
But they also have a secret for our future , a future that we need to have to think about changing challenges , through greater creativity and @@UNKNOWN@@ cooperation .
The secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
In other words , play is our @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In order to make a successful world , we have to play .
But are we going to make the best from our @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
@@UNKNOWN@@ is not silly .
It 's critical .
For example and human rights , the life is not just teeth and teeth .
Just even though it does n't seem to be a game game .
And so , my @@UNKNOWN@@ , let 's give us this gift of evolution , and we play the creativity and the wonder .
Thank you .
I want you to put two together in the middle , at TED , at the same day , at the same moment , every day -- a baby .
So two groups , every single baby .
Now I do n't want you to do it too much more than that , because if you imagine the whole time that you 're not going to listen to you .
Imagine just a moment .
And in this case , you can imagine that in a case , the @@UNKNOWN@@ has a Y @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is the X - ray of the protein .
And in the other case , it gives the X an X - ray , which is the X - ray of the protein .
Both are @@UNKNOWN@@ , both of them .
We 'll go back to these people .
In most of my activities , I have two tons .
I 'm wearing a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And I 'm an economist , and in this case , I study how people with HIV @@UNKNOWN@@ -- the human body , animal body -- how they interact with them , with @@UNKNOWN@@ ; how they were thinking about
The other voice I 'm working with my work is the @@UNKNOWN@@ , as @@UNKNOWN@@ -- or , as I sometimes say , when @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ -- of people who are patients by doctors .
In this case , I 've been working with people who have evolved , the social norms in the question .
So , I 've been working with people who are identical to the birth of two , two people in a body .
I 've been working with people working with @@UNKNOWN@@ -- so people who were smaller .
And very often , I 've been working with a lot of people working with their gender gender gender -- so people who do n't have the average male or female female .
And as a general term , we can use the word word .
@@UNKNOWN@@ comes in many different shapes .
I 'm just going to give you a few examples of the kinds of guys who do n't call the male or female .
In a case , you might have someone with a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and the gene gene of the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ , which we have @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , all of them .
And that 's why the @@UNKNOWN@@ are in the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But because this individual does n't have to recognize the gender , but the body is not wrong with the gender .
And this is called @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So much more importantly , but no response .
Now , as a consequence , the body is more of the female female population .
If that kid is born , it looks like a girl .
She 's a girl . She 's going to be a girl .
But it 's mostly a little bit of it , and she 's going to grow their trees , and they 're growing up , and they 're developing , but they 're not going to go back to someone
And they 're going to do some tests and find out that it 's rather than and @@UNKNOWN@@ , and it 's inside of them , and it turns out that they 've got a telescope .
And that 's important to understand that you might be the person in the male male , but they 're not really .
Women , like men , in our body , which is called @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They 're in the back part of our body .
And the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , which are the social properties .
Most women , as I believe -- I think a typical woman -- I do n't know my reality , but I think that I probably think the typical -- most of the women I 'm going to talk about
We make @@UNKNOWN@@ , and we talk to speak .
The result is that someone like I was actually a brain that more @@UNKNOWN@@ was more than a woman who was born with , and a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So gender is really complicated ; it 's not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in some ways , they can spread across the whole range of all .
Another example : a few years ago , I got the call of a 19th - century man who was born as a boy , as a boy , he had a friend who had sex with his friend ,
He had an extreme form of a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He has @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and in the @@UNKNOWN@@ , his @@UNKNOWN@@ were so very active , that they basically have a male @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And as a consequence , his husband 's male male , his brain was the @@UNKNOWN@@ male part of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And when he was born , he looked like a boy from nobody .
And yet , when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , actually , because he was @@UNKNOWN@@ , that the doctors said that he was in the female .
Okay , just a quick example for another version of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Some of them with some genes , a little bit of @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is called the @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We do n't know exactly why this happens .
So gender , in many different ways .
The reason why children with this kind of body -- that it 's @@UNKNOWN@@ or birth , that it 's @@UNKNOWN@@ -- from fact that we often have to be the norm , but not because it 's for their
In many cases , these people are perfectly healthy .
The reason why they 're often different ways of @@UNKNOWN@@ , are because they 're not our social categories .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , our system on the idea , which is a certain amount of value with a certain identity .
So we have the idea to be a woman who has to be a female identity , a black person , but to be an African African in terms of history .
So we have this terrible idea .
And when we face with a body that we 're actually doing something very different , it makes us a bit more likely to that .
So we have a lot of the ideas of ideas .
And our nation is really based on a very romantic idea of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Now you can imagine how amazing it is when children are born , the two people are in a body .
Where I 've been experienced in the last time of all of my life , the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ last year , gender gender in the @@UNKNOWN@@ World in Berlin .
Many people who call me a question : " What do you want to do , which tells us , whether @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ or female ? "
And I had to explain the journalist that there 's no test .
We know now , gender gender is enough that we have to admit that the nature of us are not @@UNKNOWN@@ between a male between female and female , or between male and female and female , and we 're
So we 've got a situation where we 're going to go beyond our science , and we have to give it more , that we 're going to have those categories that we 've been doing for our own
And that 's not just in terms of gender .
It also also changed against race , which is even more complicated than our @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We 're going to put together in all sorts of things .
We also think about the fact that we 're at least 95 percent of our DNA with chimpanzees .
What are we going to start with the fact that we 're going to keep them from a little bit different ?
While we 're going to keep our science further forward , and we 're going to live in a @@UNKNOWN@@ of the area where we need to recognize that the @@UNKNOWN@@ categories that we have were probably too bad .
We see this in all sorts of the human life .
One of the areas that we see in the middle of our modern culture , in the United States , are the fight over the beginning and the end of life .
We 've got a lot of conversations about what 's going to be a body for people , so that he has one another right than the @@UNKNOWN@@ life .
We have a very hard deal -- maybe it 's not as public in medicine -- about the question , when someone is dead .
Our ancestors had never been able to fight with the question , when someone was dead .
They gave someone a spring under the nose , and when they moved , they did n't have it yet .
If she did n't move more , you 've got them .
But today we 're in a situation where we 're going to use people organs organs , and they want to people others .
And as a result we 're going to do with the struggle with the really hard question , when someone is dead , and that makes us a really hard way to do that we do n't have so much
Now , you would notice that the whole @@UNKNOWN@@ of categories of someone would make me really happy .
And I 'm political political , I @@UNKNOWN@@ people with unusual , but I have to admit it makes me nervous .
And to realize that these categories are much much more than we thought , makes me say .
And it makes me realize what I think is democracy .
So in order to tell you about this moment , I have to first first , because I 'm going to have a big fan of fathers .
I know they were @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I think they were so strong and strong , and so forth that what they did is that I would all take me back to a few years of @@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and it 's not because of
It 's because of what happened with the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The fathers of the last year from my view of the original organization , including , and that 's why .
What she was @@UNKNOWN@@ was a concept concept , and she did it through a different , the radical and beautiful .
How do you remember what we 're going to do with our own idea of the concept of @@UNKNOWN@@ , and the @@UNKNOWN@@ was in the reason that we 've been based on a very clever idea of neuroscience .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ of the world had no idea based on the DNA , but they had a concept of the concept .
They had a concept of blue blood .
They were the idea that people who have political power , these political power should be , because of the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ to the father and son .
The third - year ago , these ideas came back , and they brought through a new idea , and this idea , the idea said that all of the people were connected .
They @@UNKNOWN@@ the study , and decided that it was surprising , the common differences , not the differences . And that was very radically .
So they made that part , because they were part of a @@UNKNOWN@@ system in the two things together .
The democracy grew up , but at the same time , there was also science science .
If you look at the story of the fathers of fathers , I think that many of them are very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a world of a world .
They went away from @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I think things like a @@UNKNOWN@@ concept of power , back , where the brain is based on a very @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They moved to a @@UNKNOWN@@ concept .
And if you look at it , it looks like the natural language , talking about nature and the God of nature .
They do n't talk about God and nature .
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
And as part of it , it brings us a concept of what we were common with .
And so they 've created a wonderful way to think of the future societies .
They did n't think about it , but what they did for us , was great .
So what happened next ?
For example , women who have the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , the concept of @@UNKNOWN@@ , who says that the most important thing is the most important difference , and we said , " that we 've got a broken and
And women believed that .
The next thing that we did was successful successful civil society , where we saw people like the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , " Am I no woman ? "
We find men in the @@UNKNOWN@@ series of @@UNKNOWN@@ , who say , " I 'm a man . "
Again , people like color , which is based on common differences in terms of common differences , again , successful .
We see the same thing with the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Of course , the problem is , and we 're going to begin to see all the things that we 're going to have to ask about , why we 're going to make certain things .
Now , again , I 'd like to make certain @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , in our culture .
For example , I do n't want the same rights like a human rights .
I do n't want to say that we should take care of the ignorance .
I do n't want to say that the @@UNKNOWN@@ should be right , you have to use their @@UNKNOWN@@ or sex .
So there are some of the @@UNKNOWN@@ that make sense for me , and we think I 'm going to keep it .
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they 're and why we keep them , and whether they make sense .
So let 's go back to these two creatures in the beginning of the talk .
We have two creatures , both in the middle of the same day .
Imagine us that one of them , birth , three months ago , she 's born in June June .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , on the other hand , is born to the @@UNKNOWN@@ , he 's born in the March of 1980 .
It 's just because of the fact that @@UNKNOWN@@ were nine months later , and they were all sorts of different kinds of @@UNKNOWN@@ -- the right to have sex , who are right to choose to do the right
@@UNKNOWN@@ has to wait for all of this , because it 's actually a different biological age , only because of the birth of his birth .
We find other other things about what their rights are .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , because you feel that he 's a male -- although I do n't tell you that he is with the @@UNKNOWN@@ -- that you can say that he 's male , and he 's going to have to
AK : You ca n't see in all the states in the same way , which is @@UNKNOWN@@ in all states , and that 's right .
@@UNKNOWN@@ can be a woman with a woman , but you can only get a woman in the United States .
So we have these two - dimensional categories that are in many ways , and we 're vulnerable .
And for me , the question is , what are we going to do , because our science can make progress in progress in the field that we need to get a point where we need to say that democracy
I do n't want to tell the science , but at the same time , it does n't even feel as if the science works itself .
So where do we go ?
It seems like that our culture is a way of change , " Good , we have to go somewhere somewhere , so we 're going to go somewhere somewhere . "
But a lot of people get into a very strange position .
So , for example , Texas , one of them was decided to be a man who 's going to get married , you do n't have a telescope , and a woman would be married , you have a
Now in practice , people are not tested at their test .
But it 's also very weird , because of the story that I told them to talk about the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
If we look at one of the most of the democracy of modern democracy , Dr. Martin Luther King , he gave us in our " I have a dream of a new solution .
He says , we should n't ask people , " but it 's not for the quality of their character , and it 's so beyond .
And I want to say , " Yeah , that sounds like a good idea . "
But how do you do that in practice ?
How do you ask people from their own ?
I also want to point out that I 'm not sure that we have rights rights to people , because I have to make sure that I 'm going to have a series of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , which probably probably
I want to make sure that I 'm probably going to see some of the light @@UNKNOWN@@ , and the most importantly , @@UNKNOWN@@ and social decisions have to increase their sexual relationships than some people I know .
How do we ask the question for the properties of the character 's character ?
It turns out it really hard .
And one part of me , what if if the content of a character would be something that would be in the future -- how @@UNKNOWN@@ could be made ?
Do we really do this direction ?
I 'm not sure where we go .
What I know is that it 's really important to think about the idea that the United States is very important to think about questions about democracy .
In our own democracy , we 've done our right right now , and I think we would make our things in the future .
We do n't have the situation , like , for example , in the case of Iran , where a man who is , to respect to other men , including the death is , it 's because he 's
In this way , it does n't exist .
I 'm happy to tell you that we do n't have these states -- a surgeon who I talked with a few years ago , a couple of thousands of birth with them , and she was able to separate
But when I asked him with him , and he asked him why he did this experiment -- it was high - @@UNKNOWN@@ surgery -- it was his answer , in his country , these kids were very bad to
And I asked him , " Well , do you have political political rights , instead of making surgery surgery ?
The United States can have incredible opportunities to allow people to allow the people that they 're not without changing it to the state of the future .
So I think we need to be strong .
Well , just to conclude , I want to notice that I 'm very much talking about the fathers .
And I want to think about the way that democracy might look like , or looked like , if we had to have more mothers .
And I want to say something that is a metaphor , and I think that there are different kinds of ideas that can be different from the other species of human beings , if people are @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
For years , because I was interested in social science , I 've been interested in research in the area of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And one of the things that I really was really interesting , is the difference between men and women in the way they think and think of the world .
What we 've learned from studies studies is that women , in average -- not every one , but in the average -- more and more common to social relationships and the social people who are within the group of
And so , when we think about it , we have an interesting situation .
A years ago , when I asked a student , I asked one of my @@UNKNOWN@@ who was interested in my -- and I was like , as I was , as I do it , I really want to
He said , " Tell me what the female is female . "
And I thought , " Well , this is the last question I 've ever heard .
In fact , it 's about talking about gender gender , because it 's not female .
But the more I thought about his question , so much more I thought that there was something that was going to be in @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So this should be something that 's going on in average , a lot of women 's brains of male - related to us with social social relationships , and @@UNKNOWN@@ for the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So where the fathers of @@UNKNOWN@@ were extremely likely to learn how individuals were able to protect the state of the state , so it 's possible that when we give more mothers in this concept , we do more
And maybe this is where we go into the future , when we 're democracy democracy through HIV -- less about the individual body , and more about relationships .
That 's what if we 're trying to create a social connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
Thank you very much .
I 'm @@UNKNOWN@@ and I 'm here .
But before I show you what I 'm going to do with you , I 'm going to have a very popular job , and this is , I 'm obsessed with @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I love to have a chance to make a different @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and in the last time , and at the last time , and I had to watch .
But I do n't buy anything new .
I get all of my clothes from the hand hand on @@UNKNOWN@@ and in the same hand .
Very nice , thank you .
The same hand - @@UNKNOWN@@ allows me to change the impact of my @@UNKNOWN@@ on the environment , and also the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I 'm going to meet all sorts of great people ; my dollar use for a good purpose ; I see quite unique .
I mean , what will I find today ?
Is it my size ?
Will I like the color ?
Is it less than 20 dollars ?
When I have answers answers , I feel when I won .
I come back to my pocket , and I tell you what I 'm going to think about this exciting week here at TED .
I mean , what makes someone with so many @@UNKNOWN@@ with me ?
So I 'm going to show you exactly what I brought with .
I brought up a couple of my pair of friends , and that 's all .
@@UNKNOWN@@ for exactly a week , all I did in my pocket .
I 've made me that I would do anything else that I 'd like to give you , if I was going to go back to @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And you do n't hear me as a woman who 's here at TED in her @@UNKNOWN@@ -- I mean , I found a few things .
And I 'd like to show you my name for this week .
Is that good ?
While I 'm going to do this , I 'm going to give you a few of the lessons that I believe if they believe it or not , from this art , nothing to do .
Let 's start with .
I call this @@UNKNOWN@@ .
You do n't have to spend a lot of money to do it .
You can almost almost look like less than 50 dollars .
This whole @@UNKNOWN@@ , including the @@UNKNOWN@@ , I brought up with me , and it was the expensive piece that I 've been doing in this whole week .
DH : color is something @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's almost impossible to be bad , if you 're @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
If you 're happy , you keep others happy .
CA : @@UNKNOWN@@ is completely completely .
I 've spent a lot of time in my life , trying to try to myself myself , and I 'm at the same time .
Be just who you are .
If you 're talking about the right people , they do n't understand it , they will also value it .
KS : @@UNKNOWN@@ your personal kid .
Sometimes people tell me , I would look like if I 'm going to play back , or I remember it .
I like to say , " Thank you . "
@@UNKNOWN@@ : @@UNKNOWN@@ is the key .
If you think it 's a good thing , it 's almost safe .
And if you think you do n't look at something good , you 're probably right .
I grew up with a mother who taught me a day for day .
But just when I got 30 , I really understood what this means .
And I 'm going to talk about that .
If you believe that you 're inside the outside and a wonderful person , you do n't have anything that you ca n't wear .
So there 's no sorry for someone here in this audience .
We should be able to do anything that we 're looking at .
Thank you very much .
DH : A universal truth -- five words : @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And finally , no , a personal , unique , personal style of design , is a great kind of world to talk something about a little bit without talking about a word .
It 's always been told me , and again , once in this week , people came to me , just just because of what I was wearing . And I had great conversations .
Of course , that does n't make anything in my tiny tiny .
So before I go back to school , I 'm going to put it all back .
Because the lesson I 'm trying to learn about this week is that it 's okay .
I do n't have to get this stuff out of it , because the way around the corner is always a different crazy , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , which only just to me , when I love a little
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Good afternoon , all together .
I 've got something I want to show you .
Think about this as a as an airplane .
That 's what we call in our lab , design design .
Let me tell you a little bit about it .
So if you look at this image -- I 'm an @@UNKNOWN@@ , and every year in Italy , with this image in his room , but the reason I 'm going to show you this in the formula is
In a few years ago , that if you were going to win a formula to win , you would take your budget and your money on a good driver and a good car .
And if the car and the driver were good enough , you won the race .
Now , today , if you want to win a race , actually , something like this here -- something that 's like the car in real time , a couple of sensors that have information from the car ,
This would be , in @@UNKNOWN@@ , a real - time control system .
And basically , it 's a system that 's from two parts -- a @@UNKNOWN@@ part and a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Now , what 's interesting about this is the real time of real life in our lives .
Our cities have been in the last few years ago , just with networks and electronics .
They 're going to be computers .
And as computers in the open , they start looking at other ways and they 're going to look at it .
If we are cities , it 's actually a big thing .
Just by the way I want to say that cities are only two percent of the Earth 's surface , but 50 percent of the global population live there .
They 're 75 percent of the @@UNKNOWN@@ -- the weight to 80 percent of CO2 emissions .
So if we do something with the cities , this is a big thing .
Over the cities , all of this material and @@UNKNOWN@@ in objects of the everyday life .
This is from an exhibition called the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ later in the year , during the University of organized .
It means " me . "
Now , all our objects , our environment , starting to go back to us .
In a certain sense , it 's almost like if any of you can make it out there in the two and a grid and a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And this is changing the interaction that we have people with our environment .
In a way , it 's almost like the old dream of God ...
You know , " David @@UNKNOWN@@ , called it that he ended up at the end , and he @@UNKNOWN@@ him on him -- and you can still see a little place , and she said , " @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@
Now today , our world 's first for the first time to ask us .
I 'm going to show you a few examples -- again , with the idea of our environment , and I want to go .
Let 's start with it .
Now the first project I want to introduce to you is in one of the first of our lab .
It came from four and a half years ago in Italy .
And what we did there was actually a new kind of network that was used to all of the world .
The summer was a happy summer in 2006 .
It was as Italy , " Italy .
Some of you will remember that it was like Italy , France , and then at the end of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And does n't matter , Italy .
Now you see what happened in this day , just in the activity of the activity that happens in the network .
Here you see the city .
You see in the middle of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The morning .
You see the same time .
In the afternoon afternoon , people here , and there 's the phone calls and move .
The game begins .
France makes a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , people want to make a short call .
Second @@UNKNOWN@@ .
First , second .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , in a moment of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Italy .
Now , in this night , all the @@UNKNOWN@@ would go to the center .
They saw the big deal .
The next day , everybody went to the center to the Minister and the Prime Minister at the same time .
And then all down .
You can see the image of the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , where , for the University of time , the people who go to celebrate -- to have a great party , and you can see the @@UNKNOWN@@ at the end
Now , that 's just one example , how we can feel the city today , in a way we can do it in a few years ago .
Again , another thing for example : this is not about people , but to use things that we use and consume .
Now , today we know all about our things .
This is a map that shows you all of the chips , which is a perfect computer , how they came together .
But we just know a little bit about where things go .
So , we 've created a little bit of these structures to play the waste through the system .
So we started with some of the volunteers that we 've done with a little more than a year , in Seattle , who have made things that they 're @@UNKNOWN@@ -- different kinds of things you can see --
And then we 've got the little chips that little little bit of the things in the @@UNKNOWN@@ and started him .
Here 's the results we 've just got .
@@UNKNOWN@@ to ...
After a week .
With this information , we realized that there 's a lot of @@UNKNOWN@@ in the system .
We can do the same thing in the way that they do with less energy .
The data was not available available .
But this is a lot of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and more complicated things .
The other thing is , we believe that if we see every day , that the cup of the cup that we 're missing is not just going to disappear that it 's still somewhere on the planet .
And the plastic bottle that we throw away every day .
And if we show the people , we can make a change behavior .
So this is the reason for this project .
My colleague at MIT , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , could give you a much more about the same and the many of wonderful wonderful things that you can do with it , but I want to talk to the second part
And the first project is something we did a few years ago in @@UNKNOWN@@ , Spain .
It started with a question of @@UNKNOWN@@ , who came to us , and I said that Spain and @@UNKNOWN@@ had a beautiful tradition , in public places as part of architecture .
And the question was , how could we create technology , new technology to connect ?
And one of the ideas that were at MIT in a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ were asked , and then you see these @@UNKNOWN@@ , and @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ and open .
They 're going to use something like a @@UNKNOWN@@ with water from water .
If you 're able to do this faster , you can write them , you can see patterns , text .
And you can imagine it , and he 's going to open it to open up how you can look at this image .
Well , we launched the mayor @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It was like him .
And we got the building to build a building in the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We called it the digital water .
The whole building was water .
There are no windows or windows , but if you go to him , it will open and open it .
The roof was also covered with water .
And if it 's when you 're going to measure the power , you can actually make the roof down .
Or you could build the building and the whole architecture , as in this case , you know , that days , if you 're the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and say , "
No , they did n't do the buildings , it 's just so that the architecture is almost disappear .
Here 's how the building works .
You see the person who 's asking what happens inside .
And here 's what I 'm trying to do when I tried to test the sensors that the water does n't open up .
Now , I 'm going to tell you something about a night when all of the sensors are going to work .
But actually , it was a little bit more fun .
All children from @@UNKNOWN@@ came up to the building , because the way they were playing with the building .
Not longer a building that would open to open up , but a building that 's still going to be down there and holes in the water , you had to have to get through @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we think about how the people who use things that we design .
But the reality is always impossible .
And this is the nice thing to create things that can be used and interact with people .
So here 's a picture of the building with the physical physical , the @@UNKNOWN@@ and water .
And this is what we gave us about this project that I 'm going to show you now .
Imagine that these could actually start fly .
Imagine if you could do small , you fly through the air , and every one of you with a little @@UNKNOWN@@ with light light -- almost like a cloud of moving through the space .
Here 's the video .
Imagine a @@UNKNOWN@@ of how you saw that what you saw before with others , completely different .
You can have these cloud .
You can have a kind of visual screen , or you see , like this -- a structure that 's built in two dimensions .
Or @@UNKNOWN@@ in three dimensions , which is what changes changes , the light is not the position of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
You can play with different ways .
Imagine that the screen could just be able to do different in any different scale or size , in different ways .
But then this could just be a 3D cloud of its way that you can get together , and through the way you can see them , you can see them in many different ways .
Here you can see a real @@UNKNOWN@@ -- which is @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , like @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
If you look at the light , it looks like this . So just as we saw it before .
Imagine that every single person from humans .
It could anyone every single one of the components that comes from people from the movements of the people or so .
I want to show you something to first .
We 've been working with @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , one of the best best of our time -- the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ at the theater theater in New York , and the @@UNKNOWN@@ in the world -- we took his
Here you see dancing dancing .
On the left hand , you see the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the various @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's at the same time .
So you can see the whole movement .
You can do that all the time .
But then , if we do all of you , you can play it up and play with color , and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That 's what we want to do as a kind of @@UNKNOWN@@ for the use of it .
I want to show you the latest project to work .
It 's something that we 're working for today .
It 's called the cloud -- the cloud .
The idea is again , imagine what we 're going to do again with people to do something to the world and changing the environment -- almost something like we call it @@UNKNOWN@@ , how do you think about a
Imagine that every one can be a little bit of a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I think that the most important thing about the last few years , the last decades is that we 're looking by a physical world of a digital world .
That has all of them , knowledge , and it makes it through the Internet .
Today , we can see the first time -- and the campaign campaign that we 've shown -- we can see from the digital world , which is the most powerful forces of the models of the physical world .
That can be in our case that we can use it to create and create a symbol .
That means something that built in the city .
But this can be able to think of the future challenges -- think about climate change , and the CO2 emissions -- how can we go from the digital world for physical change .
So the idea is that we actually actually put people together with what they 're doing together .
The cloud is a cloud of @@UNKNOWN@@ , in the same way as a real cloud of cloud .
And these particles are water when our cloud is a cloud .
It 's a physical form in London , but it 's covered with @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They can move inside the different ways of experiences .
You can see it from the bottom , the most important moments of 2012 , 2012 and @@UNKNOWN@@ , and it 's like a kind of connection to the community .
So both the physical cloud in the sky , and something on the top of you can go , like @@UNKNOWN@@ new @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They can go .
And a kind of digital @@UNKNOWN@@ in the night -- but as a @@UNKNOWN@@ , a new kind of experience that all the next to the top .
Thank you .
When artists , I 'm very important .
In my work , I 'm trying to think that people are not inspired by nature , and it 's all connected .
The first time I was almost 10 years ago in Antarctica , where I saw my first photograph .
I was convinced .
My heart @@UNKNOWN@@ , I was @@UNKNOWN@@ , while I tried to figure out what I was .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ around me was almost 60 feet away from the water , and I could just be able to see that this was a @@UNKNOWN@@ on another another .
@@UNKNOWN@@ are born as a @@UNKNOWN@@ of a glacier or by taking away from them .
Everyone @@UNKNOWN@@ their own individual .
They interact with their environment and their experiences .
Some of them are @@UNKNOWN@@ and give up to the end of the end , but other people do n't feel more and more in a @@UNKNOWN@@ of life .
If you look at a picture , you think that they 're isolated , and it 's only , as we humans humans .
But the truth is far from that .
Now , as a sudden , I 'm going to @@UNKNOWN@@ his @@UNKNOWN@@ atmosphere .
While I 'm going to break the @@UNKNOWN@@ water , it makes a lot of life @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And I 'm going to take my pictures of these @@UNKNOWN@@ as I would have made my ancestors of my ancestors , in the mind that they 're able to live in these individual moments of this way , and
It 's not death when they break down , it 's not a end , but it 's not a @@UNKNOWN@@ of their @@UNKNOWN@@ cycle .
A part of the ice in the @@UNKNOWN@@ that I 'm @@UNKNOWN@@ is very young -- a thousand years old .
And one part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
The last images I want to show you to show you , I 'm going to show you an image that I 'm going to see in @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Very rare , actually , you can actually see an explosion .
Here you see .
On the left hand , you see a little boat .
That 's about five feet long .
Please look at the shape of the atmosphere and where it 's on the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
You can see , he starts to play , and the boat has moved to the other side , the guy .
This is the average size of the spectrum .
He 's about 120 feet of water , or 40 feet .
And this video is in real time .
And just like this , you show up a different side of his character .
Thank you .
My life is really extremely useful through the work of some amazing projects .
But at the @@UNKNOWN@@ , I 've ever been working on this guy .
His name is @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ was one of the most popular artists ' 80s .
Then one day , he came from running back and said , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , my legs @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
And this was the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the engine .
@@UNKNOWN@@ is completely paralyzed .
He can only use his eyes .
I stood him .
I have a company , design design and animation , which is actually a complex part of what we 're going to live in the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So we decided to Tony Tony -- Tony -- and his thing to help .
I met with his father and his brother and his brother , and said , " We 'll give you the money .
What are you going to do with it ? "
And his brother said , " I just want to talk back to Tony .
I just want to ask him again with him , and I asked , " Well , that 's not -- I did n't know ?
And he said , " No , even if you heard about the higher level of a @@UNKNOWN@@ , and you 've got an idea that you can do .
@@UNKNOWN@@ people are not available . "
And I feel like , " How does she communicate her ? "
Did anyone look at the movie and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
This is how they communicate -- they walk their fingers .
I said , " Very @@UNKNOWN@@ , how can that be ? "
So I came with the need , just just a visual @@UNKNOWN@@ , and instead , I started a check that I did n't have the idea that I had to call it .
I put myself in place , and my face with his brother and his father -- with the words , " Good , my name is , Tony , we 're going to give him a machine , and we
Because it 's a mess that someone who has all of them in it , it ca n't communicate . "
So I talked a few months later at a conference .
I met these people from @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , the Institute of the Institute of the International Institute , and they have a technology that allow them to allow a light on each other surface , and then , with a
So you 're moving around and make @@UNKNOWN@@ like this .
They say that all the things that are up there is going to be up there , a cycle .
It starts with the @@UNKNOWN@@ , then come up with the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and the Bush Bush , and finally , most people do art .
But there was always a life cycle .
So I went home and home with my wife , and I told her all of them , and we thought , " Well , second , if you can do this technology , you can use your eyes to
That was the beginning of the journey .
And about two years later , a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of @@UNKNOWN@@ and go from things we 've got some things .
First of all , we have the support of the doors , and we actually actually have a device that can communicate with -- -- a story - like .
That was incredible .
And he 's really extremely funny -- I call him him , because you 're talking to him , or you get an email , and you think , " I 'm so @@UNKNOWN@@ , this guy is incredible .
And also , we 've been seven seven out of the world -- literally from all of the edges of the world --
My wife , my children , and I 'm in the garage , and these hackers and programmers and @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ our house .
A lot of our friends thought that we were beautiful stupid to do this , and we were @@UNKNOWN@@ and all the images of the walls were @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But for about two weeks , we 've been launched , we went to the @@UNKNOWN@@ in the world , my children were @@UNKNOWN@@ , my dog , and we created this .
It 's called @@UNKNOWN@@ and you can see the description .
This is a cheap thing that we bought at the University of New York , something @@UNKNOWN@@ and a few things from the store and the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We took a @@UNKNOWN@@ , they have @@UNKNOWN@@ them , and they put on a LED light , and now we have a device that 's open to open -- you can build it , we can make the code
So we have created a device , which is completely free .
None of them can @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's not a hospital .
Everyone can actually communicate with his eyes or communicate .
Thank you .
Thank you very much , that was incredible .
So at the end of the two weeks , we went back in @@UNKNOWN@@ room .
I love this picture , because it 's the room of someone else and that 's his room .
So here 's all of this data from the great @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And after about a year of planning , two weeks @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , the first time for seven years .
And this is an amazing picture , because this is his life system , and it 's going to be about what 's going to be about his life system .
We 've got bed bed for him to see outside .
We 've made a set of @@UNKNOWN@@ on a wall of the hospital before the hospital .
And he put it back to the first time , in the family of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what a sense of the surface was in the room .
In fact , we also had to keep it in the room that we felt so much as a part of the @@UNKNOWN@@ scene .
At the end , he asked us an email with the content : " The first time I 've done something I did .
I have feeling that I 've got under water , and finally , someone gets down down and down to my head , so I can breathe . "
Is n't that mind ?
That 's something like our @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That 's what we 're going to keep with the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and we can continue to continue .
And we need to do a lot more about this device .
It 's an amazing device , but it comes from a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And someone who has created this potential potential to make more much more .
So we 're trying to figure out how to make it better , faster and stronger .
Since that time , we have all kinds of information .
We won a few prices .
Remember , it 's free , no one of us .
It 's all from our own pockets .
So the @@UNKNOWN@@ were , " Oh , that 's fantastic . "
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ on us , and then , in December December , we 've been told the last year , when one of the world 's best in 2010 , what was really great .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ of this is -- and this is the whole circle -- that there 's this April , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in the city of Los Angeles , which is the way of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And there may be quite quite the most successful @@UNKNOWN@@ of the United States -- @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ -- all these guys will be there .
It 's going to be part of the show , which is pretty obvious .
So basically , I 'm thinking about if you see something that is impossible , then you can do it .
Everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , the microphone , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ -- everything was impossible .
Make it possible -- all of you here .
I 'm not a blind , and I did n't have anything to do with it , but I just got something like this , and I met with incredible people with so that we can put something in the
And this question should , everybody would ask you , and every single day is going to tell you something that is going to be done ? If not , when do I do , and if I do n't
Thank you .
So , I write for children , and I 'm probably going to be @@UNKNOWN@@ America .
And I 'm going to tell people that I 'm not like a scientist .
You can get me as a farmer , or in leather , but nobody has ever ever been able to sell farmers .
Today , I want to tell you about circles .
Well , an amazing thing is going to be something that you find because you see it somewhere somewhere .
You go to the @@UNKNOWN@@ and take it as an @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This is a painting of a circle .
One of my friends made it -- Richard @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's the way I 'm going to tell you today today .
My first started in the ' 60s in the ' 60s high school in @@UNKNOWN@@ , at the University of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I was the one that every week in the @@UNKNOWN@@ of green and blue , became a teacher and my life .
She saved my life by using me using the toilet in the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And she did .
They did it three years .
I had to go away from the city .
I had a thumb I had 60 dollars , and I decided to think of San Francisco in California -- I found a @@UNKNOWN@@ -- and back in the ' 80s , I found it to work with AIDS organizations
About three or four years ago , in the middle of the night I started a call from this teacher , woman who said , " I have to see you .
I 'm sad that we do n't have ever known as adults .
Can you go to college , and please come up with the guy who I know you have found it .
And I should say that I want to be @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I want to let you go . "
Now , the next day we were in college .
We looked at them , and we laugh , and we knew that they had to be in a horse .
We found one of them , we took them down , and we were taking care of them , and we gave it to their family , because it needed it needed .
It was something that we did .
And just as the woman who knew me as a adults learn how to learn , and she turned into a box , and I was in my hands .
What happened happened was that the circle was closed , and it became a circle -- and the @@UNKNOWN@@ I 've talked about .
The myth is , death is a part of life .
She saved my life , and my partner and I saved her .
And you know , this part of life takes all of the rest of life .
He needs truth and beauty , and I 'm so happy that this is so much later .
He needs it -- and it takes dignity , love and joy . And it 's on us to give these things .
Thank you very much .
Imagine a big amount of time when you go to 1,000 feet .
Imagine an airplane .
Imagine the engine , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That sounds scary .
Well , I had a unique place on this day .
I was the only person to talk to the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So I looked at them , and they said , " No problem , we 've got a few birds . "
The pilot had done the machine , and we were n't so far away .
You could see in Manhattan .
Two minutes later , three things happened .
The pilot @@UNKNOWN@@ the machine after the @@UNKNOWN@@ River .
That 's not the end line .
He 's going to move off .
Imagine a @@UNKNOWN@@ airplane .
And then he said three words -- the words words I 've ever heard .
He says , " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
I did n't need to talk more about the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I could see it in her eyes , because it was @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I want to tell you three things that I learned about this day .
I learned that in a moment .
We have these @@UNKNOWN@@ , we have these things that we want to live in life , and I thought to all the people that I wanted to make a hand , and I did n't do all of the
While I was thinking about that , when I was a saying , " I 'm going to say bad . "
Because when the wine is , and the person is there , then I open it .
I do n't want to do something more in life .
And this argument , this goal , changed my life .
The second thing I learned about this day -- and that was , when we asked the George bridge , which was quite a @@UNKNOWN@@ -- so I thought , man , is a thing that I really mean .
I had a good life .
In my own humanity , with my mistakes , I 'm going to get better into what I 'm doing .
But in my humanity , I gave me my own room .
And I 'm @@UNKNOWN@@ the time that I 'm trying to make things out of @@UNKNOWN@@ , with people who have something .
And I thought about the relationship with my wife , with friends .
And after that , when I thought about it , I decided to take a negative energy from my life .
It 's not perfect , but it 's much better .
I did n't have two years ago with my wife .
It feels great .
I 'm not trying to have more . I need to choose to be happy .
The third thing I learned -- and in the middle of the stage , " 15 , 14 , 14 , 14 , 13 , ... "
You can see the water .
I said , " Please @@UNKNOWN@@ in the air . "
I do n't want it to be this thing in 20 parts of how you know it as well .
While we had , I had this feeling that man is not going to die .
Almost that we were going to keep our lives on it .
But it was very sad .
I did n't want to go ; I love my life .
And this nervous system really really thought in a thought , which I 'd just like one thing .
I wish I could see my children growing up .
About a month after a month of my daughter -- I did n't have a lot of talent talent .
@@UNKNOWN@@ .
And I @@UNKNOWN@@ , I like a little kid .
And in the world , all of a sense of me .
I realized that I was going to draw the points that it 's in the life just about a great father .
More than anything , all other , is my only goal in life , a good father .
I was not surprised at this day .
I got a more gift , and in the future , and back and differently and differently .
My call at all of us , who are going to fly today , do you think the same thing on your flight -- please -- but imagine it ?
What would you do it up , because you think you 're going to be there ?
How would you change your relationships and the negative energy ?
And more than anything else , are the best parents who you can be ?
Thank you .
The idea behind the @@UNKNOWN@@ machine is pretty simple .
We do n't want us to Iran .
The most important thing in the development of nuclear power is the high - @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The gray areas that you see here is the real time .
Now , if we can do the systems of systems , which are @@UNKNOWN@@ and control , and we can actually get a lot of problems with the speed .
These areas are not working with soap software ; they 're based on a completely different technology .
But if we do it , it turns out a way of the virus virus on a laptop @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is used to be used to be the dark box , and we 're in the store .
And this is the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So we start with a toilet machine .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ are going to be dark in the dark box , the @@UNKNOWN@@ and the nuclear nuclear power program .
That 's a sound , right ?
I want to tell you how we found it .
When we started to study our research at six months ago , it was completely different , which was the meaning and the purpose of this .
The only thing we knew was very , very complicated , which is the most part of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ part , he made by @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And it seemed a little bit of @@UNKNOWN@@ , with these little @@UNKNOWN@@ , these @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ of our attention , and we started a @@UNKNOWN@@ project where we started to protect our environment with people , and we studied this building .
And then something happened .
Instead , like a @@UNKNOWN@@ , who did n't like our cheese -- @@UNKNOWN@@ , but he did n't eat him .
This did n't make any sense .
And after we had a different species of cheese , I went on to that this is a @@UNKNOWN@@ attack .
@@UNKNOWN@@ a certain goal .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in the dark box , when you saw a special structure , even when the program program , it will lead to the end .
And if it does n't do anything .
So , I really started interested in my interest , and we started working with it , almost all around the clock , because I thought we do n't know what the goal is .
It might say , for example , an American American power , or a @@UNKNOWN@@ in Germany .
So we should be going to figure out what the goal is .
So @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ , we found the code code , and found that it 's in two digital @@UNKNOWN@@ -- a smaller and a bigger .
And we also realized that they were very trained to be inspired by people who were clearly all @@UNKNOWN@@ information .
They knew some of them , and @@UNKNOWN@@ that they had to attack .
They probably knew the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So they knew everything .
And when you 've heard that the @@UNKNOWN@@ of complex complex and high - tech , you 're going to tell you that these are a science for us .
It 's much more complicated than anything we 've ever seen .
Here 's a clip from this code code .
We talk about -- about 3,000 lines .
It looks pretty like , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And I want to tell you how we could be from this code .
So what we were looking for was the first one , looking at @@UNKNOWN@@ , because we know what they do .
And then we were looking for @@UNKNOWN@@ , and we tried to do this with the real world in the world , with potential potential in the real world .
So we needed things about this goals that we could go back and wrong .
In order to make these theories , we call us in memory that it 's definitely definitely about @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , it needs to be a powerful goal , and it 's very likely to be in Iran , because
Now , in this area , there are n't several thousand targets .
And basically , it turns out to the power of power power and on the @@UNKNOWN@@ in @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So I said to my office , " @@UNKNOWN@@ me on a list of all experts for @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ from our clients . "
And I called it , and she 's aware of her knowledge to see how to compare what we compare in the code and in the data .
And this worked very well .
So , it was possible to find the little digital @@UNKNOWN@@ with the @@UNKNOWN@@ connection .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ is the moving part of the light , the black object that you see .
And if you start the speed of this @@UNKNOWN@@ , it 's actually in the order to get the light down , and eventually even to turn it down .
What we 've found out is that the goal of the attack was actually going to slow it down , and it 's clearly in trying to try to do it , so they 're not going to be able
The great digital @@UNKNOWN@@ -- we got a little bit by looking at our very data and data .
So for example , the number of @@UNKNOWN@@ is very different from this code ; you ca n't stop .
And I started thinking about scientific literature , about how these @@UNKNOWN@@ were built in New York , and found out that they 've been built , so that it 's called " @@UNKNOWN@@ , " and every @@UNKNOWN@@ contains
So , that makes sense .
And it became better .
These @@UNKNOWN@@ in Iran are separated in the site .
And guess what we found in the @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
A almost similar structure .
So again , this really fine .
And this gave us a huge confidence for this , which we 've studied .
Now , do n't understand me that was n't just so .
These results have been done by several weeks .
And often we were just going to end up with a @@UNKNOWN@@ and we needed to collect .
Anyway , we found that both of the digital @@UNKNOWN@@ in reality , and the same goal of @@UNKNOWN@@ , but from different directions .
The little bit of it takes a @@UNKNOWN@@ , and @@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and @@UNKNOWN@@ them , and the big amount of @@UNKNOWN@@ , with six pounds of interaction and interaction .
So , in the big part , and we 're very optimistic that we actually actually have what the goal is .
It 's like , and it 's just @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So we do n't have to worry about the other goals of goals .
Here 's something really cool stuff that we discovered -- it 's really made out of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In the bottom , the dark box , and you can see the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Now , what this thing is doing is that it 's the most important values of sensors -- so for example of @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ -- and it turns out to code code , which is during the trial ,
And actually , the wrong thing of data was taken out of it before .
So it 's exactly like in @@UNKNOWN@@ , where during the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ with @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That 's cool , right ?
The idea is obviously not just the @@UNKNOWN@@ in the control of the control .
In fact , it 's much more dangerous and more .
The idea is to digital digital digital .
We need digital technologies where there is a human @@UNKNOWN@@ , not fast enough .
So in a power power for example , if the Great @@UNKNOWN@@ is going to be fast , you have to have to be able to be @@UNKNOWN@@ in @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Of course , this ca n't be done by a human @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So that 's what we need .
And if the risk are really bad things .
The power power can .
And none of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and it 's going to notice that it 's going to notice .
That 's scary .
But it gets worse .
And what I 'm saying is very important .
Think about it . This attack is @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It does n't work with anything , with @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So , he would do that well work -- in a power or power in a power station .
It 's @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And you do n't have to have -- as the @@UNKNOWN@@ -- you do n't have to get the @@UNKNOWN@@ on a @@UNKNOWN@@ that we 've seen it .
You could also use ordinary @@UNKNOWN@@ technology .
You have to do it as much as possible .
And if you do that , you eventually get a @@UNKNOWN@@ of mass @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That 's the consequence that we have to ask .
So unfortunately , it 's the largest number of goals for these attacks not in the Middle East .
They 're in the United States in Europe and Japan .
So all these green areas , these are the @@UNKNOWN@@ environments .
We need to think about the consequences and we start better .
Thank you .
I have a question .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , it became a lot of them that people think that the @@UNKNOWN@@ is the @@UNKNOWN@@ behind this .
Is that your mind ?
Okay , you really want to know ?
Yeah . Okay .
In my mind , I 'm involved in @@UNKNOWN@@ , but the driving force is not Israel .
So the driving force is the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
There 's only one of those who are the United States -- to happiness .
Because that 's our problem even more difficult .
Thank you , you know , a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ . Thank you .
I spent the last few years that I 've been working in situations when they 're very difficult , and they 're dangerous .
I went to prison -- hard .
I 've been working in a @@UNKNOWN@@ -- dangerous .
I 've been shot in @@UNKNOWN@@ -- difficult and dangerous .
And I spent 30 days long , nothing than that here -- eat at the beginning , a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
In fact , I 've got the most part of my career that 's going to be able to find out of situations , and the only thing that I 'm trying to do is to try to look at
So when I knew that I would come here to talk about a conference in the world of @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ , I knew that I would make something a little different .
Some of you may have heard that I heard a few weeks ago in an ad .
And I sent a few Facebook news , some Twitter Twitter , and I gave people the opportunity to talk to my TED talk to me .
Really , some happy people and companies , @@UNKNOWN@@ -- and non - @@UNKNOWN@@ , who have an opportunity -- -- I 'm sure that Chris Anderson you never go back .
So what you got was , the name is your name here : My name , which you do n't have to know what the subject is going to be , and then you want to look at the end
But of course , it 's a very good media .
You know how many people look at the TED ?
A whole lot .
This is just the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So , of course , this morning , I knew that anyone would buy the buy .
If you asked me this year before a year , I would n't have been able to do that with you .
But in the new project , I work with my new film , we study the world of marketing .
As I said , I 've been able to do that in the last few years , but nothing could n't require me to do anything that could n't do anything like that , and so much like the guy
You know , I had the idea for a film .
So what I want to do is a film about @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , marketing and advertising , which is all through the film film by @@UNKNOWN@@ and marketing .
And the film is called " The @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
So what 's going on , " The @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ " happens , is that everything that 's up to the bottom , from the beginning to the end of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is the @@UNKNOWN@@ , which
Now this brand , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ Center ...
These people will be connected to this movie .
And so this is the whole idea -- this is what ?
I 'm a @@UNKNOWN@@ person .
That was more to the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It was " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
But we 're not just going to make the X X as a @@UNKNOWN@@ , but we 're going to make sure that we 're going to make any different word in the movie .
That 's what we 're going to do with you , and it 's going to be the best gold that you ever have .
This is the best car that you ever have before , " The @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ " the greatest drink that you 've ever had to have a attention of " The @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
So the idea is to be able to show that the sound are part of the life , actually , to bring them to make the film ?
And we actually show the whole process of how it works .
The goal of all this film is transparency .
They 're going to look at the whole thing about the movie .
So this is the whole idea , the whole film , from the beginning to end .
And I would be happy if I was going to help this .
You know , it 's funny , because when I heard it first , it 's the ultimate respect for the audience .
But I do n't know how to be people .
Did you want a perspective -- I do n't want to say , " How do you have a negative @@UNKNOWN@@ -- but you know how to develop this ? "
How much money does it need to realize that ?
One million .
And I think it 's hard to meet them , but I think it 's a certain value , some of the most important differences .
Who knows when the movie comes out , we see maybe a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
What do you believe in the answer ?
The answer is likely to be no .
But is it a hard thing for the film or a hard thing for me ?
@@UNKNOWN@@ : Both .
So it does n't mean so optimistic .
So , sir , you can help me ? I need help .
I can help .
Okay .
Great .
We need to think about the green .
Yeah .
If you look at people , you can do it .
There are some places that we can turn .
Imagine the camera .
I thought , " Imagine the camera out of " I mean , we wanted to make a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It turns out that it actually actually means , " We want to do with your film . "
And just so all of these companies , one after others .
No wanted to do something with the film .
I was amazed .
They did n't do anything with the project .
And I was confused , because I thought , the whole idea , the idea of advertising , your product so many people as possible , how many people like to see .
In fact , especially in the world today , in this interface of new and new media and the media media -- it 's not the idea to be in this new exciting @@UNKNOWN@@ , that the amount of that
No , that was what I thought .
But you see , the problem was that my idea had a mistake mistake , and that was @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Actually , it was n't the mistake .
That would n't have a problem .
That would be okay .
But that 's what this image is a problem .
Look , if you 're transparency transparency in Google -- it 's one -- this is one of the first images that looks like .
I really love your way , @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So this was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and @@UNKNOWN@@ , just to discover , and you know , @@UNKNOWN@@ .
You know , we hear a whole lot about transparency .
Our politicians say it , our president says , even our leaders say it .
But when it comes out , it 's going to be able to change anything .
But why ? Now , transparency is fear -- like this strange bears , the still @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's @@UNKNOWN@@ -- like this strange @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And it 's also very low .
What else is there ?
There 's a whole photograph of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That 's very low .
So when I started talking to the companies and tell them that we wanted to tell these story , they said , " No , we want you to tell a story .
We want you to tell a story , but we just want to share our story . "
Look , when I was a kid , and my dad told me , and she was looking at me and look at this point -- he would say , " My son , there 's every three - three
There 's your version , there 's my version , and there 's the real version . "
So you see , with this film , we wanted to make the real version .
But there was just a company , an organization to help us -- and that 's just because I had John John and Richard @@UNKNOWN@@ years ago -- I found that I had to do it alone , and I
So what you started to understand -- and what I began to understand -- was that when you start to talk to these companies , the idea that you 're going to understand is a complicated problem .
I have friends , the great , Hollywood Hollywood Hollywood , and I have friends , the little @@UNKNOWN@@ -- films like I do .
And my friends , the great , Hollywood Hollywood Hollywood , saying that the reason why their films are so successful , the @@UNKNOWN@@ is they have .
And then I say my friends , the little @@UNKNOWN@@ , films , " Well , how do we do with these big , Hollywood Hollywood films ? "
And the film is called " The @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
So what are we going to see here in the movie ?
Every time I go to the way , and always when I 'm going to open up the @@UNKNOWN@@ , you 'll see @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And every time when I can someone someone , I say , " Are you enough enough for this interview ?
Are you so much ? You see a little nervous .
I want to help you .
So maybe you should give you a interview with this little bit of @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
And then we give it a great idea .
Or , " @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ " or a @@UNKNOWN@@ , " they 'll have choice .
We 're going to be both for men as well as women and women -- @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , or a stick , whatever .
That 's the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Now , I can answer all of their questions and give you a @@UNKNOWN@@ version .
We 're a smaller brand .
That 's how you talk about the short films that we 're talking about a brand .
So we do n't have a budget of others like others .
So these kinds of things -- you know , that people think about it -- that 's kind of why we 're interested .
So what about words ?
@@UNKNOWN@@ is @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That 's a great question .
Woman : @@UNKNOWN@@ technology .
technology is not the way that you might describe something that someone who is among people .
We talk about @@UNKNOWN@@ , fresh .
And I think , " Great , " is a great word that will be a category which is going to make a bit more positive , in the contrast , " or smell . "
It takes you .
How do we keep more alive than better better , more than three times .
These things have an impact effect .
And this is a million dollars .
What about me ? What about the @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
I have to talk to the guy on the street , which are like me , the @@UNKNOWN@@ - @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I want to tell something about my brand .
How would you describe their brand ?
@@UNKNOWN@@ , my brand ?
I do n't know .
I really like to love beautiful clothes .
Woman : " @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , except on the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
All right , what is the brand ?
@@UNKNOWN@@ .
I think it 's the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the way I have , is probably @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I like many black colors , lots of @@UNKNOWN@@ and so stuff .
But I normally have a @@UNKNOWN@@ , like @@UNKNOWN@@ , or a @@UNKNOWN@@ and so stuff .
Woman : And Dan Dan would be a brand , it would probably be a classic classic @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Man 2 : The brand I 'm here is , I would say , @@UNKNOWN@@ fly .
Woman 2 : part of the other , part - of - a - year - old girl -- girl -- I do n't know .
Man 3 : I 'm the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I 'm @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in the country .
So I think that 's my brand .
That 's my brand in my little , @@UNKNOWN@@ industry .
Man 4 : My brand is @@UNKNOWN@@ , because I was @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Man five : brand @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Is that ?
@@UNKNOWN@@ : I 'm a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I 'm Tom .
Now , we ca n't all be the Tom @@UNKNOWN@@ , but I see a lot of the interface of @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ fly .
And what I realized was that I needed a experts .
I needed someone who could be able to change my head , someone who could really help me understand what you call the " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
And so I found a company called @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They have companies like @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , who helped be able to discover this .
If they could do it for them , they could help me .
They brought their pictures , yeah ?
This is me . The first picture is a picture of my family .
Tell me a little bit like this with your thoughts and feelings about you .
These are the people that I think about the world .
Tell me about this world .
@@UNKNOWN@@ : So the world ? I think the world is the world where you live -- how humans around us around the world , the family , the way you live in life and the same thing .
All of these things come and start from a place , and for me , and they began to start with my family in West Virginia .
Which is the next thing you want to talk about .
The next . This was the most beautiful day of my life .
What does that mean to the thoughts and feelings about yourself ?
It 's like I 'd like to .
I like things that are different .
I like things that are weird . I like weird things .
Tell me the @@UNKNOWN@@ -- what does it brings us ?
What 's the @@UNKNOWN@@ ? What are you with now ?
Why is it important , @@UNKNOWN@@ ? What 's the red ?
Tell me a little bit about this part .
A little more about you , you 're not .
What about @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
I do n't have to be scared . So what kind of @@UNKNOWN@@ are you ?
@@UNKNOWN@@ ! No , thank you .
Thank you for granted .
Yeah . All right .
Yeah , I do n't know what it does .
There were a lot of crazy crazy things .
The first thing that I saw was this idea that your @@UNKNOWN@@ would be two of them , but the @@UNKNOWN@@ pages -- which is the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It turns very well .
And I think there 's almost a contradiction .
And I think some companies will just focus on a strength , rather than both .
A lot of companies tend to -- and this is the human nature -- things that you 're not sure they 're going to fear fear , these elements , and you 're going to welcome you , and you
Which other men do that ?
The first is a classic , Apple .
And you can see it here , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Now , there are lots of X - ray of these things , and those three , those things that come up and go , but a brand , brand brand is a pretty strong thing .
A @@UNKNOWN@@ , brand brand . How is your brand ?
If someone would ask you to ask your @@UNKNOWN@@ , what do you want to do ?
You 're going to stand up with you ? Are you something that the blood gets into blood ?
Or are you going to go down a @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
Are you something that 's a little bit of @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , more likely ?
Right ? So , things are @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is @@UNKNOWN@@ , fresh like the @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ like @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , magic and magic like @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Or are you more like a @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
Are you @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ like @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
Are you doing , again , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , like what ?
Are you it , it 's stable , @@UNKNOWN@@ , safe , @@UNKNOWN@@ , sacred , @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ like the Dalai Lama or @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
In the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies , and the lines and @@UNKNOWN@@ -- and they said , " No , " they did n't want to be part of the project .
They did n't do anything with this film , because you did n't control control , no control over the product .
But I found 17 @@UNKNOWN@@ who were ready to be able to control the control of people with some money , and how to do it , and the way we 'd say to tell stories that we do n't
They 're telling us to tell the story of the @@UNKNOWN@@ story , so that we can tell the story in this movie , so that we 're using @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ to use the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and
We were going to be able to know that were @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In the entire city , for five years , no @@UNKNOWN@@ , no poster , no @@UNKNOWN@@ , nothing .
And we went to school in the companies to move their way back in schools schools , in America .
The incredible thing for me is that the projects I 've got from the high feedback , where I had the greatest success , which are where I 'm going to do with things right now .
And that 's what they did .
Because she @@UNKNOWN@@ the middle of them , they @@UNKNOWN@@ the government , and they said that the government may not really be interested in their sense .
I 'm going to @@UNKNOWN@@ with the artists .
I 'm going to work with him and something completely different , something that people think of thinking about our world .
And how did they do it ? What 's successful ?
Now , here 's the film in the film of the film @@UNKNOWN@@ , and we can look at it .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ was the @@UNKNOWN@@ in January , and since -- and that 's not even the whole thing -- there was a million million people from this film .
It 's actually just a period of two weeks ago .
It 's just online -- no press , no TV .
The film was not yet .
There 's not even more online . No @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He 's still done in other countries .
Well , finally , the film has a very big shift .
And that 's not bad for a project , which almost almost every @@UNKNOWN@@ , which we talked about their clients , who want to share the fingers .
Something I think I think is that if you 're going to take your chance to take risks to risks that risks in these risks .
I think if you 're going to get people out of it , you 'll get them closer to failure .
I believe that if you 're going to train his employees to take risks to take the whole company to make a profit .
I have feeling that we need to encourage people to take people to take risks .
We need to encourage people to have no fear that they might be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And finally , we should be scared .
We should have the bears in the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Just welcome to you . You want to take the risk .
@@UNKNOWN@@ a big @@UNKNOWN@@ , so we 're going to take the risk .
And finally , we should be transparency transparency .
Today , more than ever before , it brings us a little bit of a bit of technological .
And this is , with advice and transparency , my entire presentation , " I asked you to be transparency , " I 'm going to show you with my friends friends of @@UNKNOWN@@ , the $ @@UNKNOWN@@ for the
Big data will be involved in organizations all over the world .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Thank you very much .
Now , Steve , in the name of transparency , this is what 's going on with the $ 100,000 ?
That 's a great question .
I 've got a @@UNKNOWN@@ in my pocket , @@UNKNOWN@@ on the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the TED organization , the @@UNKNOWN@@ Foundation -- a check in the size of $ @@UNKNOWN@@ , to TED at TED .
My name is @@UNKNOWN@@ .
18 months ago , I was doing something else with Google , and I 'm moving on with some of the art and art .
And it took 18 months .
A lot of @@UNKNOWN@@ and stories that I can tell you , with 17 very interesting places from nine countries .
But I 'm going to focus on the show .
There 's a lot of stories about what we did .
I think my personal view is very simple with this slide and its access to them .
I grew up in India .
I was an amazing education -- I did n't have myself -- but I did n't have a lot of art , and I had no access .
And when I went , and I learned this museum , I started a lot of learning .
And while I was working for Google , I tried to make this desire -- art @@UNKNOWN@@ to do -- with technology .
We created a team , a great team , and we started with this .
I 'm going to start with the demonstration , and some of the interesting things that have happened in the project .
So you 're just too @@UNKNOWN@@ .
You can see in all these @@UNKNOWN@@ here .
There 's the @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ van .
I 'm even in one of my favorite , the museum Museum of art in New York .
You get it in two ways -- very simple .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , and @@UNKNOWN@@ , you 're in the museum .
It does n't matter where you are -- @@UNKNOWN@@ , Mexico , it makes no difference .
You 're walking around .
You want to go in the museum ?
Take the card , and you 're going on a click .
@@UNKNOWN@@ are you , you want to go to the end of the end .
Just more .
@@UNKNOWN@@ .
Thank you very much .
So I 'm here in front of my @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ from @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I see this @@UNKNOWN@@ .
If the museum gave us the image , you click .
This is one of the images .
This is all the key .
Those of you who are really interested in art , and I 'm going to click on it , but I 'm going to click that up .
This is one of the images that we have heard with the @@UNKNOWN@@ technology .
This picture for example 10 years ago , I believe .
And a lot of people ask me , " What do you get for 10 billion ? "
That 's what I 'm going to show you .
You can be very easy and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
You see something funny here .
I love this guy ; his name is @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But you really want to go deep .
And so I began to play around , and I realized that there was something that happened .
And I thought , " Well , that sounds interesting . "
I went close to see , and slowly slowly , these kids were actually going to get something that .
I started a little bit talking about some of them in the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and actually actually found that it was a game called @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is going to be a @@UNKNOWN@@ on a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It was quite popular .
I do n't know why they did that , but I learned something about this .
In fact , really close to it , you can go to the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Just to give you the idea , I 'm going to see you see what you get .
Here we were , and this is the painting .
The best part , but -- in one second .
So let 's go back to @@UNKNOWN@@ , back in New York .
Another example of me , @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In the last example , it was about finding detail .
But what do you want to see ?
And what do that if you want to see how @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ this @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
You @@UNKNOWN@@ in . You can really go inside .
I 'm going to put in one of my @@UNKNOWN@@ this image , until I 'm really at the atmosphere .
That 's not what I 've ever seen before .
Now I 'm going to show you my favorite function .
There 's still a lot more , but I 'm missing the time .
This is the really cool part , which is called my own .
Each of you , everybody -- if you do n't get rich or poor , if you have a great house -- it does n't matter .
You can go online and online your own museum -- from all these images , you can put your own collection .
It 's just going to go down -- and I created this , it 's called the power of @@UNKNOWN@@ -- you can @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That 's the " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
You can do anything with your @@UNKNOWN@@ , your friends , and so you have a conversation about what you feel when you look at that .
And I think , by the end , for me , which is all the wonderful things here from Google .
They do n't want to look from the classrooms .
I should n't say that .
They come from the artists .
And this was an experience in pain for me .
I mean , I hope that we can start with this digital medium of art , and they 're online online .
And this is the largest question that I 've been trying to say , " Have you ever done that to experience the experience of a @@UNKNOWN@@ ? "
The answer is no .
It should have the experience .
That 's it . Thank you .
Thank you .
This is a representation of your brain . Your brain can go into two parts .
That 's the left half of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and it 's the right half the self - term .
If we could have a scale that would be able to measure the @@UNKNOWN@@ of each other , we could see the brain .
For example , that someone who is completely different .
This would be someone who 's completely inspired .
Now , where would you put your brain on this scale ?
Some of us may have for one of those @@UNKNOWN@@ , but I think that most of the people in the audience , your brain is like this -- with a high - @@UNKNOWN@@ , the same thing in both
It 's not like if they 're both @@UNKNOWN@@ or so .
You can make sense and intuitive .
And so I see me when one of the people in common with most of the other scientific @@UNKNOWN@@ that need a good amount of logic to use the complex ideas together .
But at the same time , we need a good percentage of the experiments in the experiments .
How do we develop this intuition ? Well , we love to play with things .
So we go out and play it , and look at it , and then we 're going to start with our intuition .
It basically do .
So one of the results that they 've developed over the years is that it 's the same thing to be the same time .
I mean , it might be weird to think that a thing at the same time in two different places , but you were not born with this idea at two .
I remember a kid in play with a play .
He was still a @@UNKNOWN@@ and not very good at it , and he was constantly down .
But I bet that he could play the play with a very popular lesson , which is the big things that you do n't just like to leave them , and she 's going to stay in a place .
And this is a great model model of the world , so long , you 're not a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It would be a classic model for a @@UNKNOWN@@ , because they do n't play with @@UNKNOWN@@ , but with these little weird particles .
And if they play with their particles , they 're all kinds of weird things -- like they 're going to fly down through walls , or they 're at the same time in two different places .
And so they wrote all of these .
That was the state of physics in a few years ago , and it had to quantum quantum mechanics that little tiny little particles .
But you did n't need to make the big objects objects around us .
That does n't have my intuition , and that maybe just because I do n't just play with particles .
Well , I play sometimes with them , but not very often .
And I 've never seen it before .
I mean , nobody has ever seen a particles .
But my @@UNKNOWN@@ side did n't like it .
Because if all of things things are particles and all of these particles can explain , the rules of quantum mechanics , should n't just follow all the rules of quantum theory ?
I see no reason why this should n't be .
So I would feel so much better with the whole thing that if we were able to show that the rules of quantum theory .
So I made a few years ago to do this .
I created one .
This is the first object that you can see , which was in the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So what we look at here is a tiny computer chip .
And you can see this green point there in the middle .
That 's the piece of metal that I 'm going to talk about .
This is a picture of object .
I 'm going to see it . We look at the center .
And here 's a really big close to this little piece of metal .
So what we 're looking at is a little bit of metal , it 's like a @@UNKNOWN@@ , and it 's over the top .
So I made this thing on the same way you make a computer chip .
I went to a clean room with new @@UNKNOWN@@ , and @@UNKNOWN@@ for 100 hours of all the big devices .
For the last little bit , I had to use my own machine -- to see this as a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ hole and the thing .
This thing has been the ability to be able to do it , but it takes a little help to do it .
Look , let me give you an analogy .
You know how uncomfortable it is in a full elevator ?
I mean , when I alone alone in the elevator , I do all kinds of weird things , but then other other people , and I hear all of these things , because I do n't want it to
So quantum mechanics says that the objects objects feel like that .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ for objects objects are not just people , but also the light that it seems to seem to the wind and the wind , which is over and the heat of the space .
And so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , we had to @@UNKNOWN@@ all the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And we did that .
We 've got the light , we put it into a vacuum and @@UNKNOWN@@ the air air , and it was almost until the right now , in alone , was the piece of metal , and also how he
So we 've lost its movement .
We found that it really really weird .
So instead of it , it 's just quiet , it 's like it . It 's kind of like this kind of @@UNKNOWN@@ , like this , like a @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In the front of him , we gave him a little bit of light that we could use it at the same time , and not too much -- something that is just in quantum mechanics .
So what I 'm going to tell you about is really awesome .
What does it mean for an object at the same time , and not ?
Let 's think about the atoms .
So the first case , all of the @@UNKNOWN@@ of atoms from the piece of metal is still quiet , and at the same time , they 're the same atoms and then .
Just to make it @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The rest of the time are @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That means that every neuron is at the same time in two different places , which at the same time that the whole piece of music in two different places .
I think it 's really cool .
Really .
That 's worth it for all of this year in the clean room , because it turns out that you 're going to put the @@UNKNOWN@@ between one of the protein , and this piece of metal is about how
So if you 're a single rat in the same time at two different places , this piece of metal can be two different places , why do n't you ?
I mean , that 's just what I 'm wrong .
So , imagine what you might be at the same time in several places like that ?
How would your mind be able to understand your body in the room ?
There 's another part of the story .
When we looked at the light , and the light box , and the box that we saw was that the piece of music was in a piece of it .
And so I had to make this new intuition that it looks like if all of the objects in the elevator actually are just quantum objects that are in a small room together .
They hear a lot of anger about quantum mechanics , which quantum theory is that everything is connected .
Well , that 's not quite right .
There 's more more , it 's more deeper .
It 's so that these connections , your connections with all the things around you , literally , who are you , and that 's the @@UNKNOWN@@ and quantum mechanics .
Thank you very much .
In 2007 , I decided that we should think we should be thinking about economic development .
It should be our goal that if families are thinking about where they live and work , to give them the opportunity to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
At the moment we 're moving away from this goal .
There are billions of people in the developing world who do n't even have a single city to be responsible .
But the amazing thing in cities is that they 're so much more likely than it costs them .
So we could do the world with very simple , maybe even hundreds of new cities .
Now , that sounds like this , you do n't have ever thinking about new cities .
But you just do n't build the buildings on the @@UNKNOWN@@ against the cities .
Imagine that half of the people who live in our homes , they do n't have yet , but other parts .
You could try to control the capacity of the space .
But you know what you 're going to do with this , and in this room and their environment are going to disappear laws of laws , and prevent from the damage .
So it turns out to be very hard to get all of these @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But you could go to a whole new place , a whole new building , so that the laws could be able to build such a building and build it .
So I 've been saying that governments are going to create new areas that have enough place for a city , and they give them a name .
Later , I found that , at the time , about the same time , @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ about the challenge of a challenge in progress .
They knew that every year was about about @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ their country to go to the United States , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can live in their country and
And in this point , @@UNKNOWN@@ has been said , " What happens when we 're going to create a @@UNKNOWN@@ area of our country , which we 're just going to take a message of a message of the
In the summer of 2009 , there was a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In the next @@UNKNOWN@@ election , won @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in a shift , the program of innovation and also @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He asked me to be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In the moment , I was going to talk to a talk about @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In terms of @@UNKNOWN@@ , error and through the study of the way I tried to do this complicated concept of the city City on the bottom elements .
The first point is the importance of laws of laws , laws , which is that you can not have access to @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We teach new technologies , but for the progress , we need technologies and laws , and it 's for the laws of the laws of us .
In the fall of 2010 , a friend of @@UNKNOWN@@ came up with the link to the TED .
It turns out him .
The two call me .
And they said , " Let 's make the @@UNKNOWN@@ of our country . "
So we met in December in the prison of a flag in Berlin .
I 've tried to make sure how valuable cities are more valuable than they are .
And I 've been looking at this graph , to show how valuable @@UNKNOWN@@ is in a place like New York .
But it was a pretty similar debate , in a moment when it was a @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I said , " Paul , we might look at the TED . "
So I 'm going to talk to the TED conference in very simple ways that a @@UNKNOWN@@ City is a place , the beginning of the country 's @@UNKNOWN@@ , a @@UNKNOWN@@ , the laws of @@UNKNOWN@@ that there are
That 's why I was asked by the president of @@UNKNOWN@@ , who said that we need to do this project , that it 's important , and that 's the way we 're going to bring our country .
I was asked to go to @@UNKNOWN@@ , and even the fourth and a half a day , a day .
So I have an other thing to say about the talk , which is a graph like this , which is trying to make sure that if you want to value a value value in a city , it 's
This is a picture of the city , and the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ the new @@UNKNOWN@@ , which was built in the library .
In this airport , there was an area of 100 @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So I tried to convince the @@UNKNOWN@@ of them if you want to create a new city , where you 're going to start with an area of at least 1,000 miles .
These are more than 250 thousand a day .
@@UNKNOWN@@ have all @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The faces of the audience were very serious and attention .
The director of Congress came to the stage , and I said , " Professor @@UNKNOWN@@ , I thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we might listen to the TED .
I put it on my laptop . "
So I sat down , and they have the TED talk .
And I came up with the @@UNKNOWN@@ that a new city of the people have new opportunities .
There would be a chance to live in a city that would be @@UNKNOWN@@ , instead of hundreds of miles away from the north .
And a new city also has new opportunities for leaders .
The leader of the government would be able to be able to help the help out of @@UNKNOWN@@ , they could be able to benefit from their @@UNKNOWN@@ , which they were able to get to the laws of laws
And the realization of President President was to believe that the trust of the world I 've been thinking about as a way of the foreign investment to be able to be able to build this city , and could
We were in a area .
This image is from this place .
It does n't make a thousand square miles .
And after that , at the 19th century , January , they 've been told that Congress to make a change of the prediction , to have a @@UNKNOWN@@ control , which is special for @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In a country that 's just one of the crisis in the crisis that had been published in Congress with these @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ with a voice .
All of the parties , all the society of society , they have this .
In the part of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , it has to be twice twice by Congress .
In 17 17 , it became a second time with a voice to a voice .
@@UNKNOWN@@ after this choice between between 21 , and the 24 , a half of about 30 @@UNKNOWN@@ in the two places of the world that most of them were interested in the business of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's a place .
This is a picture of a big , new urban city , which is in South South @@UNKNOWN@@ as big as the city .
Everything that you can see on this image was built in four years ago after it took four years to get the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The other place that was very interested in the @@UNKNOWN@@ , is not .
It 's been built two cities in China , and the third is in @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So if you think about it , it 's where we are today .
They already have a @@UNKNOWN@@ , and they 've got this area of the second city .
It 's going to be working on a legal system that it can allow us to be able to go to it , and it 's also going to work on a legal system .
There 's a country who has paid to follow his @@UNKNOWN@@ Court , as the @@UNKNOWN@@ for the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ are very interested .
They 're going to deal with it .
One thing you already know is that , there 's lots of them .
There are lots of companies who would love to America in America , especially in a place with a @@UNKNOWN@@ , and there are lots of people who would love to live there .
On the whole world , it has 700 million people who want to say that they want to live in a different place .
A million people are still Latin America , and go to the United States .
Many of them are fathers , who are forced to protect their families , to work with @@UNKNOWN@@ sometimes sometimes , and they need to be able to sell them to sell enough enough to make food and clothing .
Unfortunately , sometimes sometimes even children who are trying to find their parents and find them in some cases that have been seen by a decade ago .
So what is it for a idea to think about it in a whole new building ?
Or even @@UNKNOWN@@ from these cities , or hundreds of all over the world ?
So what is it for a idea to keep that every family has a choice between various cities , the competition ?
That 's an idea that 's worth spreading .
My friends from mine asked me to say , thank TED .
You know how many decisions you do in a typical day ?
You know how many decisions you 're in a typical week ?
I 've done a couple of years ago about 2,000 Americans , and the average number of decisions that are @@UNKNOWN@@ a typical Americans on a day is 70 .
It was also a study with @@UNKNOWN@@ , who was a week long ago .
And these scientists have just made the different issues that they have , and they 've got these @@UNKNOWN@@ , and they 've got to make decisions decisions with the issues .
And they found that there was an average leader in the week with @@UNKNOWN@@ tasks .
Every of these issues were , of many , many different decisions .
50 percent of their decisions have been done by nine minutes or less .
Just for about 12 percent of their decisions , an hour or more of their time .
Think about your own decisions .
You know how many decisions you 're going to do in the number of five minutes to do one another category ?
How good do you think you 're going to make the decisions ?
Today , I want to talk about one of the largest @@UNKNOWN@@ of modern modern modern day .
I want to talk about the problem and talk about some solutions .
Now , if I talk about this problem , I 'm going to show you some questions , and I want to understand your answers .
If I 'm going to ask you a question , please , because I 'm blind , just the hand , if you get some calories .
Otherwise , please , if I ask you a question , and the answer is yes , so my first question for today is : Are you ready to hear something about that ?
Thank you very much .
When I was a @@UNKNOWN@@ at Stanford University , I went to this very , very @@UNKNOWN@@ , at least at the time , at the time , he was really @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It was a store that was @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This business was almost like a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They had 250 different kinds of chocolate and @@UNKNOWN@@ and over 500 different species of fruit and vegetables and more than two thousand different kinds of water -- and that was at a time when we actually had @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I loved loved it to go to the store , but at a moment , I asked myself , well , how do they do something else ?
Here 's the oil .
They had about five different ways of oil , including including who were @@UNKNOWN@@ in the thousands of years old .
So I decided to go to one day , and I asked the director , " Is this model that you 're going to take people all of these opportunities ? "
And he showed up with the @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ , who had a day , and they started using their cameras .
We decided to do an experiment and we call it for our experiment .
Here 's her @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They had different kinds of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We have a little @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ on the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We 've got six different @@UNKNOWN@@ , or 24 different @@UNKNOWN@@ , and we looked at two things : First , what I 'd like to do more people are going to go and do it ?
It 's more people there , when it was 24 , about 60 percent , when it was six , 40 percent .
And after that , we looked at what happened to people more than a glass of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Now we see the opposite effect .
From the people who were still 24 , they were only three and a half of glass .
From the people who were left when they were six , now , we 've seen that 30 percent of them actually have a glass of glass .
Now , if you do it , buy the people a six times more of the glass , who they had six to choice , when you had 24 @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Now , if you do n't have to buy a glass of glass , it 's probably good for us -- at least it 's good for our own -- but it turns out that it makes us so much
We do n't decide to decide if it does n't make our own best interest .
So for the day of time , it was saving saving .
Now , I 'm going to describe you a study that I describe with @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , which we choose to make decisions decisions for almost a million and a half million people in
And what we were looking at is whether the number of the @@UNKNOWN@@ that would be one of the possible that we need , the @@UNKNOWN@@ plan , which is going to be more likely to be more likely to
And we found that there was a context .
So , in this case , we had about @@UNKNOWN@@ plans for the people in between two to 50 years ago .
And what we found was that the more time we 've been going to be more trained , that the fact that the @@UNKNOWN@@ rate was low .
Now , if you look at the rise , the plans , the two students were @@UNKNOWN@@ , had a @@UNKNOWN@@ in the @@UNKNOWN@@ -- still not the same thing we want .
In the plans , almost 60 years ago , the @@UNKNOWN@@ came down to about @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Now it turns out that even if you 're going to move forward , when more ways of choice , then , it has negative consequences .
So the people who decided that they decided to be more likely to be more likely to give them more , and more more likely to choose it , and their @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The more opportunities to give them more , the more they put their entire money in their @@UNKNOWN@@ .
None of these extreme decisions , which makes the decisions that someone who 's going to think about people when we think of their future resources .
Now , in the last 10 years , we 've seen a lot of people in the terms of the negative effects that the @@UNKNOWN@@ of more and more choice with choice .
They make the decision -- they do it , even if it against their own best interest .
They 're going to make more decisions decisions .
They decide more to things that they do n't even less happy , even if they do an objective better .
The main reason for this is that maybe we can enjoy it , and we do n't have this great @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ , but we do n't do that , and we can
So what I 'm going to do today today is four simple techniques -- the techniques that we 've tested on different species and on various @@UNKNOWN@@ -- that you can just use in your business .
First .
You 've heard it before , but it was never true than today , less less than that .
People are always worried when I say , " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
They 're always worried that you 're lost .
But in truth , we 'll see it more and more time when you 're ready to go down , and you 're going to be able to get more powerful opportunities , and then there 's a rise of
When I came up with some of the various @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ species from 26 to 15 percent , you 've been going to increase a rise of the 10 percent .
When the king of @@UNKNOWN@@ , 10 10 percent of the most successful @@UNKNOWN@@ were @@UNKNOWN@@ , you know that the price of @@UNKNOWN@@ percent @@UNKNOWN@@ -- a result of the two , the rise of the @@UNKNOWN@@ and the
You know , the average @@UNKNOWN@@ today today , gives you the products of products .
We 're going to be able to have a half - a - half - a - half - year - olds today today .
But the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the world is @@UNKNOWN@@ , and they 're going to give you just three products -- a kind of @@UNKNOWN@@ in a beer .
Now , in the world of the world , I think one of the best examples we 've done on the market , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the best
Everyone is working at Harvard , and it 's going to end up with a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , who really want to make a choice that are going to be paid 20 dollars , not 300 or more .
You know how people often say , " I do n't know how I do it .
It 's all important opportunities . "
And the first thing I ask the employees is , " Tell me how the opportunities are different from each other .
And if your employees do n't have @@UNKNOWN@@ , you can not be your clients . "
Now before before we started @@UNKNOWN@@ , I had a conversation with smart .
And scientists said that he would be ready to all people in this audience , and all of the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ on the New @@UNKNOWN@@ of the world .
Here 's a description of the street .
And I 'd like to read you .
And now I 'm going to give you a few seconds to read them , and then I ask you , when you 're ready to listen to it .
Okay . Everybody 's ready to help it .
Are that everyone ?
Well , let me show you something more .
They knew it was a trick , right ?
Now , who 's ready for this journey .
I think I 've heard more hands .
Good .
In fact , this is what you think about the first time , more than the same time , when the second time , but I would think it would be , you know , again , the second time
Because the images took it to feel real .
Which brings me to the second technology that makes you help with the problem of @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's about why people have to understand the difference between ways to understand what the consequences with the individual opportunities are , and the consequences of these consequences are going to be able to make it .
Why do people spend 15 percent 30 percent more than if you use a card card card or a card card than it ?
Because it does n't really make money .
And it turns out that if you make it a little bit of it , it makes a very good tool to make people to save more .
So , we 've been working on a study that I 've done with @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , we 've done a study with the people in @@UNKNOWN@@ -- the people who were working for @@UNKNOWN@@ -- and
And during this conference , we 've got this conference right here , as they were still , we just have a little bit more .
The little thing that we were doing was , we 've been asked people to ask us all about the positive things that would happen in their lives when they save money .
In the way we did this simple thing , there was a rise of the @@UNKNOWN@@ to 20 percent , and there were a rise of the number of people who were willing to pay for 10 or a half
The third technology : @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We can do better with more categories than more choice than others .
Here 's an example of a study that we did in a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It turns out that it 's in the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and at the bottom of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the number of different kinds of scientific @@UNKNOWN@@ up to @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But guess what ?
If I give you a lot of films , and they 're in 10 categories , or I give you a lot of headlines , and those in 20 categories , you believe that I 'm going to give you
Because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
Here 's two different @@UNKNOWN@@ .
One is called " jazz " and the other name is " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
If you think it 's left the left side , and the @@UNKNOWN@@ on the right is the piano you 're in your hands .
Okay , there 's a few .
If you think it 's on the left side of jazz , and the one on the right side , you 're going to give you .
Okay , a few more .
Now , it turns out that you 're right .
The one on the left side is the jazz and the thing is , but you know what ?
This is a very @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Those do n't have to say that some of the things do n't say to the choice of choice .
And this problem is often , if you look at the long range of all this effort .
Who want you to do it ?
My fourth technology : I think of complexity .
It turns out that we 're going to deal with more information than we think we need to use it .
We need to understand the complexity .
I 'm going to give you an example of what I mean .
So let 's take a very , very complicated decision : @@UNKNOWN@@ the cars .
Here 's a German woman who gives you the possibility to make your car completely completely @@UNKNOWN@@ .
You have to have to make different decisions to make your car very different .
Now , these decisions are made by the choice that they make a choice .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ of the cars -- I 've got opportunities .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ -- four opportunities .
So what I do is , I 'm going to move the order to make the decisions .
The half of the clients is going to be done by a lot of opportunities to create @@UNKNOWN@@ to the low opportunities , four organs .
The other half of the people are from the low - scale opportunities to four four - year - olds , to the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
What do I look at ?
How are you interested ?
If you use the sound in the decision that means that you 're going to get away , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , I lose .
What you 're trying to find is that the people who make the amount of people who go to the low @@UNKNOWN@@ and always go to the vote .
We lose them .
If they move from the other choice to the amount of them , they remain .
It 's the same information . It 's the same number of opportunities .
The only thing I 've done is the order to change this information .
When I start with the simple thing , I 'm learning how I 'm doing .
Even though I do n't use any of the things that I do n't want to do anything about my teeth at the point that I 'm still doing it .
It turns me in a lot of the great product that I 'm doing , and so I 'm willing to help me .
So let me ask .
I 've told you about four techniques that the problem of @@UNKNOWN@@ -- -- -- they 're going to find the alternative markets -- @@UNKNOWN@@ -- -- it 's real ; we can do better with more categories , less
Every of these techniques that I 'm going to describe to you today is to be able to help the possibility of good -- well for you , you can be able to use yourself for good people who are
Because I believe that the key to the best choice is that you choose to choice .
And the more we 're going to choose to choose more than the better , we 'll be able to create the art of the decision .
Thank you very much .
Hi . I 'm Kevin @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ - @@UNKNOWN@@ with YouTube . I 'm looking for YouTube videos .
That 's true .
Today we want to talk about how videos are coming up , and then , why this is important .
We all want to be a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ -- when I was young , it seemed so difficult .
But @@UNKNOWN@@ , it allows us all of all of us , or all our creative ideas are going to be famous in a part of the culture of our world .
Every one of you might think about the Internet until next to be famous .
But in YouTube , more than four hours a minute is a minute .
And again , it 's just going to be a tiny amount of death , and it 's going to be thousands of thousands of times , and so the cultural moment .
So how does that work ?
Three things : @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ and the unexpected .
Well , we want .
Oh my God . Oh my God .
Oh my God !
@@UNKNOWN@@ !
@@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ !
Last year , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ this video that he had before his house in the @@UNKNOWN@@ National Park .
In 2010 , 23 million years ago .
This graph shows how it looked like the video last summer of the first summer .
In fact , @@UNKNOWN@@ did n't want to make a video video .
He just wanted to make a rock .
Because you just do that when you 're @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He had a lot of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And this video was actually already in January of January .
What happened here ?
There was a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the video of the last century was so popular .
Because , like @@UNKNOWN@@ , let 's imagine new and interesting things , and show them a big audience .
It 's @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ . @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ on the @@UNKNOWN@@ . @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ to the @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ . @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ . @@UNKNOWN@@ , you do n't want to think we 're going to talk
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ " is one of the videos of the year .
It was almost 200 years ago .
That 's what the graph looks like .
It 's exactly like " @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ " " it seems to be done .
What happened to this day ?
Well , it was Friday .
If you want to know , these other @@UNKNOWN@@ are also @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But what about this day , this particular morning ?
Now , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ on a lot of blogs .
Michael @@UNKNOWN@@ from the @@UNKNOWN@@ Science theater was one of the first people who asked about a joke .
So what 's important is that one individual or a group of @@UNKNOWN@@ from a @@UNKNOWN@@ , with a big audience , and the process .
And then this community of people who came up with this great deal , and began to talk about it and talk about it .
Now there are 10,000 @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ " in YouTube .
And in the first seven days , there was a @@UNKNOWN@@ for every single day .
In other words in the conversation of the 20th century , the @@UNKNOWN@@ of our community is going to become this phenomenon .
" @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ " is animation and music in @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's pretty simple .
This year was almost 50 50 years ago .
And if you do it as crazy , you know that there 's one of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the four million times .
Even cats are looking at this video .
@@UNKNOWN@@ look like cats watching this video .
But what 's important is that creativity in the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
There was @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Someone made an old version of her .
And then it started .
A whole set of community community out of the ground , which makes it a stupid joke to something that we can do .
Today , we do n't just use fun to do something we do .
Who would have that ?
Who would have been @@UNKNOWN@@ , or @@UNKNOWN@@ , or " @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ "
Which @@UNKNOWN@@ would write write in some of these things ?
In a world , in the next minute two days of video , it can only be unique , and I think about the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the stories .
I 'm going to do it , I was n't very important , when I was a friend , I 'd like to look at this great video , about a guy who 's in New York on the New
I got a lot , because I did n't go on the @@UNKNOWN@@ , but I often do n't have the challenges that we do n't want to go back to the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And this was surprising surprising , and it was a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ idea and his argument to five five times .
This approach is true for everything .
And that makes us a big question .
What does that mean ?
@@UNKNOWN@@ .
What does that mean ?
@@UNKNOWN@@ , creative @@UNKNOWN@@ , completely unexpected , which are the characteristics of a new way of media and culture , which has access to access , and in the audience .
As I said , one of the right now , we had a @@UNKNOWN@@ called @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Nobody has to give you some ideas .
And today , we feel all of us in our culture .
And that 's not the characteristics of the media media , and they also meet them in the media of today , but they 're going to get the conversation of the future .
Thank you very much .
How can I live in 10 minutes over the world between women between three generations , and how the amazing strength of that connection in the life of a girl - old girl , when she was about 30 years
The story is not yet .
It 's a puzzle that 's going to be .
I want to tell you some of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Imagine the first piece : a man who will be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He 's a poet , a writer , a man , the whole life of the simple hope of human and freedom .
Now think of him in the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ in the front of the eyes , as he wants to say that his life was a single waste .
The words , so long with his friends , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He moved back to the silence .
He died through the story .
He 's my grandfather .
I never met him .
But our lives are so much more than our memories .
My grandmother never never never heard my life .
I did n't have to worry that it did n't have been free , and it was my job to learn that the history was trying to @@UNKNOWN@@ us , but we did it .
The next piece of shows , like a boat in the early @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ .
My mother was 18 , when her father died -- in a @@UNKNOWN@@ marriage , with two little girls .
For her life , she would have a task : the @@UNKNOWN@@ of their family and a new life in Australia .
It was completely @@UNKNOWN@@ that she could fail .
After a @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , a ship on the sea , as @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
All of them were aware of the risks .
The biggest fear of them had died , and death .
Like most of the adults in my boat , my mother was a little @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In a @@UNKNOWN@@ , I did n't have my sister and I was , and she was , and my grandmother .
My first memories are from this boat -- the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of the engine , the @@UNKNOWN@@ of each wave on the atmosphere , the @@UNKNOWN@@ and open horizon .
I do n't remember the @@UNKNOWN@@ , a lot of times , but in the end of the men of the men on the boat , we could go to the engine of the engine , six hours .
But I remember the light of the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ coast , and on the young man , who died , and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the taste of
No apple did it again .
After three months in a camp camp , we were in @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And the next thing is about four women in three generations , creating a new life .
We let us go down in @@UNKNOWN@@ , one of the middle - class @@UNKNOWN@@ , the population of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In other ways , in the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , their existence , completely unknown , I did n't have any @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The smell from the @@UNKNOWN@@ came from the rest of the world .
And the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ were @@UNKNOWN@@ between people who had one thing together .
My mother worked on @@UNKNOWN@@ , then on a line in a @@UNKNOWN@@ , six days , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It did n't kind of time to find out , and English @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We were poor .
Every dollar has been done , and more in more education for English and mathematics , which we needed to do it , and most of the new things that were always coming from .
Two pair of school for school , each of the holes in the other way .
A @@UNKNOWN@@ until the @@UNKNOWN@@ , because she had six years .
And there were the rare , very painful , " @@UNKNOWN@@ " and here and here , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , goes home . "
After where ?
Something @@UNKNOWN@@ me .
There was a meeting meeting , and a voice voice said , " I 'm going to go from the way . "
My mother , my sister and I @@UNKNOWN@@ in the same bed .
My mother was every night , but I told each other of our day , and we heard the movements of our grandmother in the house .
My mother was suffering from @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And it was my job , every night night , until her to come up , she came up with him .
She @@UNKNOWN@@ a computer company , and then a @@UNKNOWN@@ , and she was still a business .
And the women came with their stories about men who do n't change the crazy , crazy and @@UNKNOWN@@ , and @@UNKNOWN@@ children , between two worlds .
@@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ were looking .
@@UNKNOWN@@ were built .
I lived in @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In one of them , I was the classic classic @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In the other , I was alive in life 's life , @@UNKNOWN@@ the violence of violence , and the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But so many years ago .
And for this help , I became the last year of @@UNKNOWN@@ as young as the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the year .
And I became a @@UNKNOWN@@ of the next year , and the @@UNKNOWN@@ did n't fit together .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ , which was now @@UNKNOWN@@ , and @@UNKNOWN@@ and social @@UNKNOWN@@ who were talking to places where they 've never heard , and in their own life , they never could have ever
I was not familiar with the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I did n't know how to do that .
I did n't know how to talk about wine .
I did n't know how to talk about anything .
I wanted to go into the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the life of an unknown @@UNKNOWN@@ -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters , all of the days of their days as a few years ago
I told my mother , I would n't do that .
She reminded me that I was so old when she had the boat .
No one has never been an opportunity .
" Do n't say , " she said . "
So I talked about @@UNKNOWN@@ and education , and the @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And the more I talked about , the more I should say .
I met people in all of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , so many of them did what they loved to live in the borders .
And although I had my degree , I realized that I did n't get to a career in my career .
There was still something else .
And I realized at the same time that it 's okay to be a @@UNKNOWN@@ , a @@UNKNOWN@@ , new @@UNKNOWN@@ , and not just fine , but something that you have to be grateful , maybe a gift of
Because @@UNKNOWN@@ can be so easy to avoid the @@UNKNOWN@@ , so that you can take the assumptions of the environment .
And I 've been enough enough to my @@UNKNOWN@@ to know that , yes , the world @@UNKNOWN@@ , but not as you like it .
@@UNKNOWN@@ that were not allowed to be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
There was a energy , a lot of optimism , a strange @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ and the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So I followed my feeling .
I took a small team of people to me for myself , which does n't make a @@UNKNOWN@@ challenge .
One year we did n't have it .
And at the end of every day , I love a huge grain of soup , which we shared .
We were working late at night .
Most of our ideas were crazy , but they were a brilliant brilliant thing , and we created the breakthrough .
I met the decision to go to the U.S.
After just a journey .
My feeling again .
Three months later , I went back and I had this adventure .
Before I want to talk to my talk , I want to tell you about my grandmother .
She grew up at a time in the @@UNKNOWN@@ of social social and the local person who was most important person .
Life had not changed for centuries .
Her father died after birth birth .
Your mother moved her alone .
With 17 , she had the second woman of a girl who was mother .
Without a man of her husband , she was a @@UNKNOWN@@ by making it out of his trial and @@UNKNOWN@@ in her own case , and a bigger greater than she won .
" Go not " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
I 'm just sitting in a hotel room in France , when she died in 1,000 miles away .
I looked through the @@UNKNOWN@@ and looked at the other side .
I knew she had come to @@UNKNOWN@@ .
My mother called me a few minutes later .
A few days later , we went into a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and he sat down with his @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We told her stories , and they were told that we were there .
At the end of the late and the guy , he said he had to win the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
My mother asked us to use her hand .
She asked the @@UNKNOWN@@ : " Why is her hand , so the rest of her is so cold ? "
" Because she gave her tomorrow , " he said .
" They did n't touch . "
If there 's a family in our family , then it 's through women .
If you were who we were , and how life lives with us , we can see that the men that might have been alive in our life that we had come in the world .
The failure would be too easy .
Now I 'd like to have my own children , and I think that the boat .
Who would ever want one ?
Yeah , I fear fear , @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Can I give them some of them in their lives , the sounds of all the wave , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , that does n't make it up ?
I do n't know .
But if I could give it , and I could be sure I could do it .
Also , @@UNKNOWN@@ mother today here in the fourth , or five .
I 'm here to share my photography with you .
Is it everywhere ?
Because this is not a picture that you ca n't do with his camera .
But yet , my interest in photography , when I started my first digital camera , at the age of 15 years .
I 'm going to do it with my former boy , for example , but it was a little different way , because in the use of the camera , it was a little bit of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And if you take a picture with a camera , the end of the process when you get to the cause .
For me , it seemed like to move to me , right at the right place at the right place .
I believe everybody could do that .
So I wanted to make something else that starts with the process when the result is going to get the cause .
@@UNKNOWN@@ like this : a site of a whole street street .
But it has an unexpected idea .
And anyway , a better level .
Or just like this -- dark and @@UNKNOWN@@ , but all with the common goal , to make a better level .
If I say reality , my picture .
Because , of course , it 's not something that you can really open , but I want to look like this , but if you could have it , it would have a picture .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , where you have to have a short moment to find the trick .
So it 's more about an idea when it 's a moment .
But what 's the trick that it looks like ?
Is it the detail or the colors ?
Is it light ?
What does that mean ?
Sometimes it 's the perspective .
At the end of it , it 's about how we think about the world , and how they make them on a two - dimensional area .
It 's not about what 's interesting , but what we 're trying to do .
So I think it 's very simple .
I see them as a puzzle of reality where you can make different parts and we can create an alternative reality .
And let me show you a simple example .
We have three - dimensional physical objects that we can recognize all of us in a three - dimensional world .
But in a certain way , it can be able to create something that can still be three - dimensional structure than whether it could exist .
But at the same time , we do n't know that this is not possible .
So what we do is we need our brains , because our brain is just not just to make it really makes sense .
And I see the same process in the images of photos .
It 's really just about making different experiences .
So the things that look at a picture is that I think it 's the things we do n't think about the things around us in our lives .
But if we 're taking photographs , it 's really important to think about it , but otherwise they just kind of wrong .
So I would say that there are three simple rules on the rules that have a result result .
As you can see , these are not three special pictures .
But they can do something special like this .
So the first rule is that the photos photos have the same perspective .
Second , two photos have the same @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And these two pictures of these two @@UNKNOWN@@ -- from the same level and the same @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Third , it 's about to do it impossible to do things , where the individual images are starting and end up with it .
It 's impossible to say , as the photograph was actually published .
So if you see color , contrast and contrast to the edges of the individual images , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , like @@UNKNOWN@@ , color colors and @@UNKNOWN@@ , we see the limits between the different images , and we see
Here 's another example .
You may think it 's just a landscape , and the bottom part of it .
But this picture is actually completely inspired by photos of different places .
I personally think it 's easier to create a place when you find a place , because you do n't have to be @@UNKNOWN@@ with the ideas in his head .
But it requires a lot of planning .
And when I had this idea in the winter , I knew that I had to wait for several months to plan to make the different places for the parts of the puzzle .
For example , the fish was taken in a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The flag is from a different place .
It 's a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And yeah , I even put the house down on the island of red @@UNKNOWN@@ to look at it .
In order to make a result result , it 's going to look at me from @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I 'm always going to start with an idea .
Then it 's about the combination of different images .
And here 's every piece of very well .
And if you can make good pictures , it can be pretty nice , and it 's very simple .
So it 's all the tools there , and the only thing that we do is our imagination .
Thank you very much .
I 'd like to talk to you about why , so many examples of the same projects .
And I think that the most important point is that we have stopped with our patients .
And one of the things that we launched at the University of the University University was a @@UNKNOWN@@ audience .
In fact , it 's not particularly scientific evidence -- it makes a cup of coffee or tea and tea and the patients , families , happy , " How does it ? "
How can we help you ? "
And we think we want to think that this is one of the most important problems , why all -- maybe only the most of the medical use that we need , because we stopped listening .
This is my wireless @@UNKNOWN@@ . A very simple thing .
She 's got a button .
And everyone morning .
And yes , I have a task , as you may recognize .
I have my job at five pounds .
It works very simple : Every time I 'm looking at the scale , they send my data on Google .
And there are also some of my @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , so he can see where my @@UNKNOWN@@ is , and it 's not just in the moment that I need to support , or so , but also with a
There 's another thing .
Maybe it 's familiar with me , I 've seen over 4,000 4,000 on Twitter .
So every morning , I 'm going to focus on my wireless -- and the people talk about me before before I 'm in the car , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , just just a little bit of @@UNKNOWN@@ today . "
But this is the @@UNKNOWN@@ , which can happen , because this is the @@UNKNOWN@@ , to be able to help patients , because that might be against obesity , or maybe it could prevent patients .
But it could also be used to be able to make people out of their chairs , and they 're going to get together in some kind of play in order to control their health .
In the next week we go to the market .
It 's going to give this little blood blood pressure , which you put on an iPhone or so @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And it 's going to allow people to be able to grow their blood vessels at their blood , to use it to their doctor and to give him a little bit more than 100 dollars .
At the point where the patients go into the game , you ca n't just control the control , the @@UNKNOWN@@ on your own ship , but we can also help us in the health care of the challenges that
Do n't use how to use it , and you start with this patient patients in the team .
And you can do that way , but also by @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And one of the things we 'd like to do with you with a quick video .
We have all of our cars in our cars .
Perhaps even in our cell phones .
We know exactly exactly where all the machines are around around the world .
We still know where all of you are there .
And clearly , we can get food food .
But where would the next generation to help this patient ?
We have @@UNKNOWN@@ , and nobody knew it .
Nobody knew one of the next - year - saving life in this moment .
So , what did we do ? We 've built in the Netherlands .
We 've created a website , and I asked a question , " If you 're going to see a @@UNKNOWN@@ , please share with you , where he is when he 's on fire , " because it 's
And over 10,000 years ago , in the Netherlands .
The next step was trying to find the Internet .
And we created an artificial app .
We 've created an app for @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ reality , to find these @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And if you 're in a city like @@UNKNOWN@@ , and someone 's going to be able to use your iPhone , and within the next weeks , your Microsoft cell phone to find the next is to save the
And today , we do n't just like that , but it 's not just like @@UNKNOWN@@ , as the product is called , but also as @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And we want to put this on a global level .
And we 're going to ask our colleagues on the world , from other universities , so that we help us help how to follow the other way around these @@UNKNOWN@@ around the world .
And if you 're in @@UNKNOWN@@ , and someone gets away , it 's your own experience or someone else , you can find a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The other thing that we want to ask is that companies are moving around the world that we have to help us with .
These could be @@UNKNOWN@@ , or engineer , for example , just to make sure that the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ is still on his place .
Please help us and try and do n't want to improve health , but in your hand .
Thank you very much .
Today I 'm going to think of unexpected discoveries .
I work in the @@UNKNOWN@@ industry .
And my little @@UNKNOWN@@ , we want to make sense of the environment .
@@UNKNOWN@@ it .
Here 's a quick video of what we do .
Oh . A moment .
It takes it up to it .
Now -- we can just do that -- I 'm just going to click the video .
No .
That 's not ...
Okay .
@@UNKNOWN@@ is ...
Oh , my time is over ?
Okay . Thank you very much .
So , a few years ago , I started a program to start with the stars in technology and design to take a year and go into an environment , which is pretty much everything that they really hate to
The program is " @@UNKNOWN@@ for America " and it 's a little bit like the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We choose every year and we let them work with @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Instead of taking them into the third world , we send them in @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And then they developed amazing robots , working with urban workers .
But what they really do is to show what technology is possible .
So let 's imagine Al .
Al is a @@UNKNOWN@@ in the city of Boston .
Here it looks like when he comes after a date , but what he really is , he 's someone who is @@UNKNOWN@@ , when he 's @@UNKNOWN@@ , he 's not very good at the @@UNKNOWN@@ when he 's
How did he come to this particular way ?
We had a team of @@UNKNOWN@@ in Boston in the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the history of America .
They were there in February , and it did last last year .
And she realized that the city never took this fire fire .
But there was a certain evidence , a man called @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and it was something else , and that was that the people who were using the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , right in these parts .
So he did what everyone 's good to do , he wrote an app .
It 's a nice little app , where you can fire fire fire .
You put it to him free , if it @@UNKNOWN@@ .
If you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first Al .
If you do n't do that , you can take it away away .
So there 's a nice little game dynamic .
This is a very small app .
It 's probably the smallest of the hypothesis that have created the best written in the last year .
But she does something , no other @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's fast .
There 's this guy in the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of the city , which is that he could n't use this app , not for snow , but the way that we 're going to @@UNKNOWN@@ the tsunami .
It 's very important to make the tsunami -- but the people make the batteries .
So he got the citizens to do it .
And then decided to use the app to use the citizens to get the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And it 's just launched by the people who are @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , when it @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We know about nine cities to make the app to use this app .
And she has spread , and , of course .
If you know something about @@UNKNOWN@@ , you know that it does n't normally work .
The supply of software takes a rule for a few years .
We had a team that last last year in a project in Boston , for the three people and a half months .
It was about a way of trying to find out of the parents who can find the right public schools for their children .
We were told later that if it was about the normal site , it took over two years , and it took about two million dollars .
And that 's not anything .
There 's a project in the California , which has spent the last two billion dollars , and it does n't work .
And there are projects like this on every level of government .
So an app that 's written in a few days , and it turns out of @@UNKNOWN@@ , it 's a kind of @@UNKNOWN@@ in the @@UNKNOWN@@ on the institution .
It shows how the government could work better -- no more than a personal company , how many people think it should be .
And not even like a technology company , but more like the Internet itself .
And that means open access , which means open and productive .
And that 's important .
But more important of this app is that it 's a new generation , which is the problem of government , not as the problem of an @@UNKNOWN@@ institution , but as a problem of collective collective .
And this is a very good news , because it turns out that we 're very good in the collective process of technology .
Now there 's a great community of people who create the tools that we need to create things together .
It 's not just " code for America , " and there are hundreds of people in the country , the @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , every day in their own communities .
They did n't leave the government .
They 're very frustrated with her , but they do n't trust it , they do it .
And these people know something that we lost from the eyes .
And that 's when you all have your feelings about politics and the @@UNKNOWN@@ and all the other things that we 're really talking about is government , in the essence , in the words of Tim @@UNKNOWN@@ , "
Today , a lot of people gave the government .
And if you 're one of these people , please , I 'm going to talk about it because they change things .
The politics does n't change ; the government is changing .
And because the government finally changed their power from us -- let you think about it , " We like the people ? " -- how do we think about how this change happens .
I did n't know very much about government when I started this program .
And as many people , I thought that it 's about government , which is about people in a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Now , two years ago , I came up with the last thing that it was all very poor .
This is the call - @@UNKNOWN@@ Center for service and services .
And you 're going to get out when you 're in your city @@UNKNOWN@@ .
If you 've ever got the chance to go to your head - old Center Center , like our @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , as part of the program -- in fact , they do all of them -- you can see
And Scott @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He 's called " @@UNKNOWN@@ " in the database .
And he did n't really have a idea . He starts with the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And finally , he says , " Look , can you just open all the door into your house , and very beautiful music , and see if you 're going to eat the @@UNKNOWN@@ ? "
And this worked .
But that was not the end of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And it did n't just have a call - Center Center .
It has an app , a solar cell phone cell phone , called @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We did n't have this app .
This is the work very smart people in the office of New York @@UNKNOWN@@ in Boston .
One day -- this is a report report -- this is what I 'm going to do . "
How do I get away ? "
But what happened with " @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ "
Scott Scott @@UNKNOWN@@ person .
But there " @@UNKNOWN@@ " is all the public , so that everybody can see it .
And in this case , he saw a neighbors .
And the next one we 've got was , " I went there , and I found the @@UNKNOWN@@ behind the house .
@@UNKNOWN@@ ? Yeah . @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ on the site .
Good evening , cute cute . "
Pretty simple .
That 's great . Here 's the digital world .
And it 's also a good example of how the government is going to get into it .
But it 's also a great example of the government as platform .
And I do n't really have a technical definition of the platform .
I 'm talking about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
A citizens helped one other citizens , but the government was playing a central role .
They created these two people .
And you 'd have them to do with national government , if that needs to be , but a leader is a much better and economic alternative to service services .
If you want a leader to help others , our communities .
Let 's take the @@UNKNOWN@@ , it costs a lot of money .
One of the most important things we need to think about is that government is not the same as politics .
And most people understand that , but they believe that one is the consumer capital of others .
That 's what we need to use to the system .
How often do we have a political leader -- and sometimes we have a lot of energy to use a new political leader , and then we 're going to go back and we expect that the government , our
That 's because the government like a whole ocean is politics and politics are the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And what happened is , what we call it .
And we use this word with this behavior .
But it 's this behavior that this thing we can do , and we 're going to pay something that is against us , something else , and then we @@UNKNOWN@@ ourselves .
People seem to think about politics .
If we want it to work this institution for us , we need to make it sexy .
Because this is where the real thing is happening .
We need to go to the power of government .
So the @@UNKNOWN@@ movement has done it .
Did you see these guys ?
It 's a group of social citizens , which has a very high - report report , which is a answer to the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ across the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That 's not political . That 's active active .
Now , for those of us who have the government , and it 's time we think about the world that we want to teach our children .
You have to make the enormous challenges that they have to imagine .
Do we really believe that we can do what we need to do without without creating an institution , which is in the name of us ?
A government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be more efficient .
The good news is that technology is possible to create the function of the government in a way that can actually do something that can lead to society .
And there 's a generation , the Internet Internet , and the knows that it 's not so hard to make things together , you have to do the right now .
Now the average age of our age is 28 , so I 'm afraid , almost a generation older than most of them .
This is a generation who grew up with her voice for granted .
They do n't fight that fight , and we 're all fighting to talk about who they 're going to talk .
They can make their sense to each every every time , and they do it .
So , if they do with the problem of government , they do n't care so much about their voices .
They use their hands .
They use their hands to use applications to write the work of the government .
And these devices let us use our hands to improve our communities .
That could be a fire fire fire , a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , a @@UNKNOWN@@ with a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And sure , we would n't have these those fire fire all the time and @@UNKNOWN@@ people and lots of people .
But these robots are like small digital memories that we 're not just consumers , and we 're not just consumers of the government , and they 're paid .
We 're more than we are .
And we 're going to improve the government , and we do n't improve the health .
So the question I ask for you all this : If it 's about the big , important things we need to do together , all together , we 're just going to be a lot of voices , or
Thank you .
And most of my matter is to tell people how wonderful the new technologies that are at the rise , and I 'm thinking , and I thought , " I 'm going to tell you that I 'm going
I 'm going to start with you just to just a little bit boring , I 'm going to show up .
If you 're going to show up the slide .
This is a slide which I would choose from my name .
It 's not about the details of the slide , but it 's the general form .
This slide shows that one of the analysis of us about the performance of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ compared to the performance of a global @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And what 's interesting about this is that this slide , like so many other , which we often often in our field , a sort of point in a @@UNKNOWN@@ curve .
In other words , every step here is a power in the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And this is a case that we 're going to do this kind of scale on @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ curves in the field of technology .
Something very little happened here .
This is basically what I 'm going to talk about here .
So , if you please turn the light back .
Another thing , because I 'm going to put something on the paper here .
Now , why do we draw graph in the technology on @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
The reason for me , when I draw it on a normal curve , where we say , this is the last year , so the @@UNKNOWN@@ of a species , and this is a @@UNKNOWN@@ of technology that I
You see this .
And that does n't tell us a lot .
Now , if I 'm going to make a different technology , we 'll say a @@UNKNOWN@@ , then that would be on the scale of the scale of a scale of @@UNKNOWN@@ , in a form line .
But if something like this happens , this is changing the circumstances .
So if the @@UNKNOWN@@ would be fast as the battery technology , it could be @@UNKNOWN@@ , we could be @@UNKNOWN@@ in a driver , and in 30 seconds , we were in Tokyo .
But this is not fast .
There 's never happened in the history of technology , this kind of @@UNKNOWN@@ growth , which is that the amount of all the exponential growth .
The question I want to ask you is , if you look at these lines , you see , they 're not going to go away .
It 's not possible to keep it all over and so fast as fast as well .
There are two options .
Or it 's going to be a classic version -- like this , until something completely new , or it will happen .
That 's about it .
Now , I 'm a @@UNKNOWN@@ , so I think that something like this will happen .
Is that really , that means we 're here in the moment in a moment .
We 're here on this line , in a transition from the world to a new way of world .
So the question I want to ask , and I 'm going to ask myself a new way , how is this new world ?
What is this new state of the world slowly ?
Because the transition seems very , very @@UNKNOWN@@ to be when you 're in the middle .
When I was a kid , there was the future somewhere in the year 2000 , and people talked about what would happen in the year 2000 .
Now we have a conference where people talk about the future , and you realize that the future is still in 2000 .
We 're not going to go .
In other words , the future every year was a year since I was in the world .
I think the reason for this is that we realize that something is happening .
The transition happens . We can feel it all .
And we know that it does n't make any sense of trying to make 30 or 50 years in the future , because it 's so different to be a simple way of what we do now .
So I want to talk about what this might be in this transition that we 're right now .
So to do this , I 'm going to start talking about some other things that are really not with technology or computers .
Because I believe this really understand that we need to take a step back , and we look at a little bit of a memory .
And that 's what I want to look at this point of life on Earth .
I believe the big picture , if you put it into some billion steps .
So let 's go back , and it 's a billion billion years . The Earth was a big , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ with lots of chemicals .
So if you look at the way that these chemicals were organized , we have a pretty good image of how they @@UNKNOWN@@ it .
I also think there 's a lot of things to understand how much we need to do with you , but I 'm going to tell you a little story about what it is that this little little bit of
Some of these oil discovered a particular combination of chemicals , which allow them to prove other chemicals from the outside , and then grow .
All of them were like this .
These little @@UNKNOWN@@ were in the senses of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But yet , of course , of course , of course , of course , not even alive in the world today , because each one of them was just a little bit of the recipe of chemicals .
And each time , if it has shared that the amount of chemicals into the amount of amounts of people .
So each other was a little different .
In fact , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , which , for a growth of growth , we could grow faster and more faster than others and also more and more chemicals from others and then faster .
So this seems to survive longer and survive it in @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting , if this is a trick of evolution .
We do n't have any kind of thing that we do n't have yet , but these @@UNKNOWN@@ have the ability to understand information .
They 've learned to be the recipe of the cell as information , and it 's in a certain chemical form that we call DNA .
In other words , they 've been able to find them in this @@UNKNOWN@@ , sort of a way that allow them to be @@UNKNOWN@@ , which they were so that this information could be connected .
The amazing thing is that this kind of information is going to store over the time of a billion billion years ago in which she came together .
In fact , the recipe for us , which is our genes that 's exactly the same code and the same thing .
And every animal use the same same and the same code .
We 're so much that we can only do the same thing that we can write in this code .
And I 've got 100 @@UNKNOWN@@ of a white @@UNKNOWN@@ , which I 'm going to be able to break down in @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And this is -- what I 've done is , I 've got this code -- the code is made of normal letters that we use for @@UNKNOWN@@ -- and I wrote my company on a piece of DNA and
So if someone 's a hundred million pounds of my company , I 've got enough for everyone in this room and even for anyone in the world , and it 's exactly here .
Would I have been a @@UNKNOWN@@ , I had written written on a virus and in the room .
So what 's the next step ?
The @@UNKNOWN@@ of DNA was an interesting step .
And the @@UNKNOWN@@ cells -- this made them happy for another billion years .
But then another thing , very interesting step , where the things were completely different , and then they started using these cells and communicate the information that would come from cells .
I do n't know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually use their DNA .
It 's also the reason why it 's not going to get rid of antibiotics .
Some of them found out how they can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get out of it , and they have
Now , this communication allows for the reasons of communities , in some sense , in the same boat , they were @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So they were either together , or they went together , and that meant that when a community was successful , all of the individuals have a lot of @@UNKNOWN@@ and learning about evolution .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ is now there , where these communities are so close to @@UNKNOWN@@ that they 're decided to use the recipe for the whole community in a @@UNKNOWN@@ of the DNA .
And the next thing happened to one another billion years .
At that point , we have @@UNKNOWN@@ communities , communities in many communities @@UNKNOWN@@ , which together as a organism organism .
In fact , we 're also a kind of @@UNKNOWN@@ community .
We have lots of cells , which are not more on their own .
Your cell phones are treated without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells , and so forth .
So these communities started changing , so that the level that goes through the evolution , not the only cell , but the whole @@UNKNOWN@@ that we call it .
The next step happened in this community .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ started @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And they developed structure structures that nothing else did , when information within the organism .
And these are the structures structures .
So the neurons are the @@UNKNOWN@@ that have built these @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They started working with experts in the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning learning , and understanding it .
And this was the brain and the nervous system of this community .
This gave them an extraordinary advantage .
Because at this point , an individual -- learning happened within the same life of an individual organism , rather than this time period .
So , an organism could learn to learn a certain @@UNKNOWN@@ , not because it was bad , and she was sick , the last time he was eating .
So this could happen in the lifetime of a single organism , hundreds of thousands of thousands of years ago , because that information has been learned from the individuals that have been killed by this disease that there were
So the nervous system has the ability to use this particular brain because the evolution could now be within one individual .
It could happen in a period of time .
What happened to this is that individual individual organisms have a way to communicate with each other .
For example , the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of this @@UNKNOWN@@ is the human language .
It 's quite an amazing invention when you think about it .
I have a very complicated , @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ idea in my head .
I 'm sitting here , and I 'm going to play a lot of sound sounds like me in a hope with a very similar idea in your head to create a certain kind of thing with my original idea
So we take something very complicated , so it sounds sound in sound to form a sequence of sound , and produce a very little bit in the minds of others .
So this allows us to be again as an organism organism .
And what we actually did , we have humanity , and we started to begin .
We 're going to see the same set of @@UNKNOWN@@ , which we 've gone through , and the characteristics of our way , how we use data , we can start .
The invention of language was a small step into this direction .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , computers , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ - @@UNKNOWN@@ , and so forth , all of our kinds of @@UNKNOWN@@ that we built in our community to create this information .
And it brings us all together to something that 's much bigger , and also it can be faster faster than we were so far .
So today , evolution can be evolution in the same time .
You 've also seen a little @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ where he saw a little bit of evolution in the @@UNKNOWN@@ program program , right in front of your eyes .
So we have the @@UNKNOWN@@ again again .
The first steps of history that I told you , a billion years a billion .
The next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , a few hundred million years .
Then the @@UNKNOWN@@ steps , like language and so forth , less than a million years .
And these next steps , like electronics , just a few decades ago .
The process is growing by itself itself , and I think , @@UNKNOWN@@ -- is the word for the word for something to be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The more it changes , the faster changes .
And I think that 's what we see here in this curve curve .
We 're looking at the process that goes from itself .
I live on the building of computers and I know that I can use the mechanism that I use to use computers computers , not using the @@UNKNOWN@@ of technology in technology .
My current activity is to create objects with such a high - term complexity that it 's impossible for me to make this in the traditional sense .
I do n't know what every single one is in the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It has billions of them .
What I 'm going to do , and what do the designers of thinking are thinking about thinking , we 're thinking about a certain @@UNKNOWN@@ , the machine , and the machine makes something that makes our ability to
And she does it with it , but we do n't even understand it .
One of the way that especially interesting is , and what I 've been doing in the last time is the evolution itself .
And we put a @@UNKNOWN@@ in the machine , which is in the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So to give an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program which is made by random random .
We say , " computers , @@UNKNOWN@@ , a few hundred million people are going to choose some of them .
Now now , I 'm going to show you all of these @@UNKNOWN@@ , and all of these programs are coming up , and we 're going to get the ones that I 'm going to do on the next
So in other words , I want to first thing what I want to do .
Let me tell you , I want to take numbers , which would be a simple example , which I 've been used for .
So look at what 's going to be able to get numbers .
Of course , the chance of going to wait to be tested , very small , they 're just going to be able to see numbers , so they 're not going to do the same thing .
But one of those people are very lucky two numbers in the right order .
Now I 'm going to say , " computers , take now the 10 percent of the sequence of what we 're going to do .
@@UNKNOWN@@ that @@UNKNOWN@@ , the rest .
So now , all of the @@UNKNOWN@@ that the numbers are at the best use .
And with a way of @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ to @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Take two programs , and they make children through the exchange of their lives , and the children of @@UNKNOWN@@ the properties of the components of the two programs .
So , I 've got a new generation of programs that were created by various kinds of things that have made a little bit of the results that were made by different .
Tell me , " Please follow this process . "
@@UNKNOWN@@ it again .
@@UNKNOWN@@ maybe some of them .
And again , again , with another generation .
All of these generations are just going to do a thousand .
And so I can create a evolution of millions of years in the computer within less minutes , or in some cases of hours .
And finally , I can start changing the numbers .
In fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program that I could ever have written by .
If I look at these programs , I ca n't tell them how they work .
I tried to understand it .
It 's @@UNKNOWN@@ and strange things .
But they do the job .
I know and I 'm sure that they 're doing the job , because they come from a series of thousands of programs that have done the job .
Because her life was out of her if they did the job right .
I sat down in a @@UNKNOWN@@ with @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , he @@UNKNOWN@@ a card , and says , " Oh look . Look at this .
And here , for this airplane , is hundreds of thousands of @@UNKNOWN@@ , which are working together to fly your breath , do n't make sense ? "
We know that it 's not a perfect level if it 's complicated .
So we 're going to go to computers computers for a process which is growing by the classic model .
He allows us to do things with a much higher complexity than it makes the normal way to make .
And yet , we understand the possibility of it yet .
So @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ technology .
We use these programs now to make computers computers faster faster than that we can be able to do this process faster .
So it 's a feedback feedback .
It 's going to faster and faster and I think that 's why it seems so @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Because all of these new technologies today are coming from us themselves .
We raise down .
We 're at a point where the @@UNKNOWN@@ is at the same time as a single - organisms organisms for @@UNKNOWN@@ organisms .
So we 're the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and we ca n't really see what the hell we 're actually here in here .
We 're in this @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But I really believe that we 'll come up with something .
I think it 's very @@UNKNOWN@@ to tell us that we 're the product of evolution .
And I think all of this is part of the creation of what 's going to be next .
Now , this morning , and I think I 'm going to stop here before I 'm going to go back .
My story starts right here in @@UNKNOWN@@ , about two years ago .
I was under the @@UNKNOWN@@ in the desert with the @@UNKNOWN@@ - @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We talked about it has n't changed since the time of the Indian Indian @@UNKNOWN@@ .
If we wanted to go back , we started in a car and @@UNKNOWN@@ across the sky .
Now we do this with airplanes .
At the time when the great Indian @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , he took a @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ in the ground and water .
Now we do it with @@UNKNOWN@@ and machines .
We came to the conclusion that magic and magic were made by machines .
That was really sad .
I got some fear of technology .
And I was afraid that I could lose the ability to lose the @@UNKNOWN@@ , without a camera and without my friends .
I found that technology could be magic and not kill .
When I was a little girl , my grandfather gave me little little @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This piece of 50 years old became the @@UNKNOWN@@ thing for me .
She became an @@UNKNOWN@@ access to a world full of @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and my images .
I came up with him when we took us to send our cameras and cameras out of it .
They were inspired by us .
And so I went into the world of technology to see how I could use it using magic .
With 16 years ago , I started books .
When I looked at the visual , I saw it as a device that I 've been able to communicate with the whole world .
It can know how we keep it .
It can know where we are .
They take pictures and text together , and animation , sounds and touch .
The media always needed more .
But what do we do ?
Now , I 'm just going to do it , I mean , an artificial artificial app .
Here 's : " @@UNKNOWN@@ your finger on each light . "
And so -- here -- " This box says , " Here I write my name .
And I 'm a character in the book .
And again , again , a letter for me down -- and this is what I know about the GPS -- I 'm the right -- I 'm right now .
So the kid in my mind is really excited about this .
I talked much about magic .
I mean , I 'm not a magician and the @@UNKNOWN@@ , but the magic of the childhood , the ideas that we had all children children .
@@UNKNOWN@@ in a glass of all the time .
So you have to do this with the iPad and the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And the light from the rest of the book .
The other idea that was taught me as a kid , is that a whole galaxy in a single bubble .
And so here 's every book and every world a little bit , I 'm going to put it back to the magic device .
And this is a map .
@@UNKNOWN@@ had always made cards , but these maps were static .
This map is growing up , and it 's on the rest of the book .
It turns out to other people in the book .
I go here .
It 's also important for me to make something that is @@UNKNOWN@@ , but also very @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This is the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We 've heard all of the @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ , but how many people outside of India have their Indian colleagues , who ?
The poor poor were thousands of thousands of @@UNKNOWN@@ in the old @@UNKNOWN@@ book .
And we bring it back in a modern story for children .
A story , with new issues , how the crisis .
The issue of @@UNKNOWN@@ , a big issue of the last 10 years is that children are in their rooms , with their computers , without @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But now , with technology technology , we can bring our children in the natural world with their technology .
In a interaction of the book , you 're going to send you a search . You have to go out and with the camera of the images of the objects .
As a child , I had hundreds of @@UNKNOWN@@ , rocks , @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ do n't make children more .
This is going to be @@UNKNOWN@@ . You have to go out , and in a chapter one photograph of a photograph of a flower .
In one another chapter , you have to play a piece of @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So , you create a digital collection of photos that you can do online .
A kid in London shows the image of a @@UNKNOWN@@ and a @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I say , " Oh , today I 've seen a @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
A kid in India says , " Today I 've seen a monkey . "
That makes a kind of social social network around a digital collection of photos that they 've made .
There 's a variety of ways of magic magic and the world and technology .
In the next book , we 're going to have a interaction with the video of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and through the reality of reality , which is looking at a plant to the house .
At one point , the screen with the screen .
You have to make the sound of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and you go back to the rest of the book .
We all move around us in a world where the natural technology is going to come and get into the magic and technology .
We use the energy of the Sun .
We bring our children and closer to the natural world , and with the magic , fun and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
Thank you very much .
This is really an extraordinary honor for me .
I spend most of my time with people in @@UNKNOWN@@ , or @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I spend most of my time with the social @@UNKNOWN@@ in the @@UNKNOWN@@ and places in the places that there 's a lot of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So here at TED , to see , and listen , like , this is a lot of power .
In the short time here , I realized that TED has a identity .
You can say things about the world .
And sometimes , when something about TED comes , it takes a meaning and force that otherwise otherwise .
I say that because I believe that identity is very important .
We 've got some amazing conversations .
I think we 've learned that the words of one might have meaning meaning , but the words of a genius were particularly important .
As a doctor , you can do good .
And so I want to talk about the power of identity .
I did n't learn from my work as a lawyer .
I learned from my grandmother .
I became a big family in a family , a traditional @@UNKNOWN@@ , who was from a @@UNKNOWN@@ , and that was my grandmother .
She was a @@UNKNOWN@@ , strong woman , she had impact .
She had the last word in every @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It was also the beginning of many differences in our family .
She was the daughter of a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Their parents were born in Virginia .
She was born with the birth of life , and the experience of life was @@UNKNOWN@@ .
My grandmother was strong , but she was also alive .
If I met them as a young boy , she came up to me and give me me .
She made me so hard that I could barely breathe .
One or two hours later , when I first met her , she came up to me , and she said , " Do you feel that my @@UNKNOWN@@ ? "
And when I said , " No , " she told me again , and when I said , " I said , " she 'd go to me .
And she was something that she was going to be alive .
The only problem was that she had 10 children .
My mother was the most of their 10 children .
Sometimes when I spent time with her , it was hard to get their attention .
My dad started everywhere .
I remember that I have to be eight or nine years that I was going to go from a morning and go to the living room . All my dad were running around .
My grandmother was at the end of the room , and I was thinking .
First , I thought it would be a game .
I looked at it , and she looked at this seriously .
This was so 15 or 20 minutes , and then she came up and come back to me .
I remember that it was yesterday .
I 'll never forget it .
She took me out to go out and said , " Well , I 'm going to tell you something , but you have to say that you 're not @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
I said , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , grandmother . "
She said , " @@UNKNOWN@@ ? " I said , " Yeah . "
She sat down , and he looked at me . She said , " I want you to see that I saw you . "
She said , " I think you 're something special . "
She said , " I think you can do anything you want to do . "
I will never forget that .
Then she said , " You have to make me just three things , @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
I said , " OK , grandmother . "
She said , " Well , first of the first time , I 'm going to tell you that you 're going to love your mother . "
She said , " Your mother is my baby , and you have to have to say that you 're always going to leave you . "
So I mentioned my mother , so I said , " Yes , grandmother , I 'll do that . "
Then she said , " I 'm going to show you that you 're always doing the right thing . "
I thought , and I said , " Yes , grandmother . I promise it . "
And finally , she said , " The last thing you have to say is , you do n't have to protect your alcohol . "
Well , I was nine years old , and I said , " Yes , grandmother . I promise it . "
I grew up in the country , in the old , rural south , and I have a brother , a year and a half - old sister .
When I was about 14 or 15 , one day , my brother came back home , and he took this @@UNKNOWN@@ beer with my sister and I was walking into the forest .
We just @@UNKNOWN@@ around it as well .
Then he took a drink of it , and I took my sister one of them , and she took them up , and then they gave me one .
I said , " No , no , no , OK . Do n't want it . I do n't want a beer . "
My brother said , " Well , do we do today today , we 're going to do that , you can do anything else we do .
I had something that my sister had said . Go , a beer .
I said , " I do n't want to power power . "
My brother took me .
He said , " What 's going on ? "
Then he looked at the face , and he said , " Oh no , do n't you still crazy crazy than the conversation with grandmother ? "
I said , " What are you talking about ? "
He said , " grandmother told all of their grandchildren that they 're special .
I was broken .
I 'm going to give you something .
I should n't do that .
This is going to be more public .
I 'm 11 years old , and I do n't know that I 've never got a drop of alcohol .
I do n't say that , because I believe that it 's a document . I say that means because of power power .
If we can make the right kind of identity , we can tell people about the things that they do n't think .
We can get them to do things that they thought they could n't .
Of course , my grandmother would say their grandmother every day .
My grandfather was during the @@UNKNOWN@@ in prison .
My uncle died from @@UNKNOWN@@ diseases .
And she believed that this was the issues that we need to do .
I tried to do something about our @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This country is different than 40 years .
@@UNKNOWN@@ were people in @@UNKNOWN@@ and in prison .
Today , it 's million million .
The United States has the highest @@UNKNOWN@@ in the world .
Seven million people have been @@UNKNOWN@@ , and with @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In my mind , I changed our world .
In social weak and black parts of the population and despair , because of these changes .
One of three men of black men in 30 and 30 is in prison , in prison , on prison , or even @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In urban communities , everywhere , in the country -- from Los Angeles , about @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ to Washington -- about 50 to 60 percent of all the young young men , either in prison , in prison ,
Our system is not just changing by questions that do n't have to do it , and it 's going to be poverty across poverty .
We 've got a country in this country , which you 're much better than if you 're rich and feel as poor and poor .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Yet , we seem to be happy with that .
The politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
We have lost .
I think that 's interesting .
There 's a few @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
My dad 's @@UNKNOWN@@ , you 're going to pay the chance when you 're @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Here , today , today , 20 percent of the male men have lost their lost .
We found that in 10 years ago , the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ is so high as the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The silence is @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I make children .
Many of my colleagues are very young .
The United States of America are the only country in the world , the @@UNKNOWN@@ children of death in prison .
In this country , we do n't have children for children 's life without any @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We 've got a lot of work .
The only country in the world .
I make people in @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The question of death is an interesting question .
We believe , because you have taught us that the real question is : Is a human being for him to die for him ?
That 's a very emotional question .
But you can also think differently about how we think about our identity .
The other view is not : Did anyone have a crime to death , but we have to make it kill ?
I think that 's fascinating .
The death sentence in America was defined by error .
In nine people who we have , we get one of the people that we have for granted , the @@UNKNOWN@@ and from the death .
It 's an amazing @@UNKNOWN@@ . One of them .
I think that 's fascinating .
We would never be able to fly someone with an airplane , if for example , for example , for example , when you 're able to fly on the airplane .
But somehow , we do it with this problem .
It 's not our problem .
It 's not our energy .
It 's not our fight .
I 'm talking about these questions .
I 'm talking about race and the question whether we have the right to kill .
And it 's exciting , because I think of my students today , I 'm talking about talking .
I 'm talking about terrorism , the time at the end of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , until the beginning of the second .
We do n't really know a lot about it .
But for the American in this country , it was a time of terrorism .
In many areas , people were afraid of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Right .
It was the fear of terrorism , their lives .
These older people come up to me and say , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , you 're going to tell you . "
They say , " No -- tell you the people that we grew up . "
And after terrorism , of course , the @@UNKNOWN@@ and decades of democracy were @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And yet , in our country , a dynamic -- we do n't want to talk about our problems .
We do n't want to talk about our story .
And that 's why we do n't really understand what makes our action in the historical context .
We 're constantly constantly .
We 're still going to continue more and more conflicts .
It seems to be hard to talk about race , and I think it 's because we 're not willing to go through the process and truth .
In South Africa , people have realized that the @@UNKNOWN@@ is not going to be able to overcome the way that we need to go to the truth and error .
Even after the genocide in Rwanda , there were these @@UNKNOWN@@ , but not in this country .
I have some talks in Germany on the death sentence .
It was fascinating , because one of the scientists started to talk to my talk , and I said , " You know , it 's extremely vulnerable to listen to you . "
He said , " Germany , there 's no death sentence .
And of course , you can never do it in Germany . "
It was completely quiet . And then a woman said , " With our story , it 's impossible that we 're ever going to get back to the killing of people .
It would be @@UNKNOWN@@ by us , and we 're human beings . "
I thought about it .
How much of it was going to live in a world where the German state of people were @@UNKNOWN@@ , especially if there were a lot of Jews .
It would be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It would be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And yet , here in this country , in the United States of the ancient world , we 're going to live people -- here 's the risk of death to die , 11 times more than when it 's
And yet there is this mental @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I think our identity is threat .
If we do n't deal with it , with these difficult issues , there are the positive and wonderful things in that .
We love innovation .
We love technology and creativity .
We love conversation .
But finally , these @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of suffering , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I think it 's important to get both together .
Because we 're going to talk about hope that we need more hope , more feedback , more commitment to create in a complex world .
For me , it takes time to think and talk about the poor , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , who are never going to be in TED .
But think about a way , in our own life .
We all need to think of the things that we ca n't see .
We do that . That 's how we 're also so powerful .
innovation , creativity , and development will not come from our minds .
They come from ideas that are driven by the citizens in our hearts .
It 's this head - heart , which I believe is that it does n't drive us , not just open to all of the light and @@UNKNOWN@@ things , but also for the dark .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , the great @@UNKNOWN@@ politicians , who said .
" When we were in Europe against the fight , we wanted to do all sorts of things . But what we needed most of the hope was hope , a mental change that people can think about in places
These mental behavior is the core of what I believe that the TED communities have to be involved .
There 's no idea about technology and design , which allows us to be able to be able to do it , and even human beings , as long as we do n't have in our eyes and ears ,
I want to say , this kind of identity is very much more than us than we do n't care about it .
She 's going to touch you .
When I was a young lawyer , I met the great privilege to meet the park .
Woman Park came over again , and after her , where she had two of their oldest friends , these older women , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , who had the @@UNKNOWN@@ - @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ -- an incredible @@UNKNOWN@@ -- and Virginia
So these women came together and talk about it .
And I did n't call my wife , and he said to me , and she said , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , woman " in the city . We want to talk .
Do you want to listen and listen ? "
And I said , " Yeah , very happy . "
She said , " And what do you do when you 're here ? "
I said , " I 'm going to listen . "
And I went over and just just stopped .
It was always so inspiring , so @@UNKNOWN@@ .
One day I sat there and I heard these women , and after a few hours , she was going to stand up to me , and I told you to say , " Well , let me tell you
What do you try to do ? "
I started with my usual talk .
I said , " Let 's try to fight against corruption .
@@UNKNOWN@@ people want to help people who were suffering .
We want to think of what we 're going to fight and the world in the fight .
We want to create a @@UNKNOWN@@ of life without @@UNKNOWN@@ for children .
We want to do something against the death of war .
We want to increase the number of death .
We want to @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I kept my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , " @@UNKNOWN@@ . @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
She said , " It 's going to be very , very boring . "
Then she did n't come up with me , put a finger on my face and said , " And so you have to be very , very @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
And I think that the TED community should be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We need to find ways to give us the challenges : these problems , the suffering .
Because finally , our humanity is all of our humanity .
In my work , I learned very simple things .
I learned some very simple things .
We 've got more of us than the worst thing we 've ever done .
I think that 's true for every person on the planet .
If someone 's lie , it 's not just a sign .
If someone does something that he does n't hear it , it 's not just a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Even who does n't kill someone , not only one .
And because this is , there 's a basic human dignity that has to respect the law .
I also believe that in many parts of this country , and with security in many parts of the Earth , the opposite of poverty .
I do n't think that .
I believe that in many places , the opposite of poverty .
And finally , I believe that although it 's so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so that we do n't end up in our technology , not to do things that we do n't think of our
And finally , a society is not going to be able to control their rich and powerful and self - treatment , but it 's how they do with the poor , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the population .
Because in this context , we begin to see the real incredible things that we see .
Sometimes I lose the balance .
Sometimes I @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I 'm sorry , and we all do .
Sometimes some of these ideas think we think about the very important way .
I 'm going to make these children who were very hard in prison .
I 'm going to go back to the New York , and a story , the age of 14 , 14 or 14 years old , and the study of the present day .
Then I wonder , how could that happen ?
How can a judge someone does something that he does n't .
The judge looked at it as adults , but I see a kid .
One night , I thought , long , and thought , my God , if a judge , we have to make something else .
Right , @@UNKNOWN@@ , the judge has @@UNKNOWN@@ .
You should also be like that .
And because it was late , and I did n't think about it , I began to work on a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I had a young , poor black boy as young .
And I started talking about this thing . The @@UNKNOWN@@ was saying , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , my poor , black black guy like a @@UNKNOWN@@ , white , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
In my name , I explained that the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ and the police and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
There was a crazy line on this country in this country , nothing more @@UNKNOWN@@ is that there is only an error .
On the next morning , I did n't know more , and I did n't even know if I was going to crazy these crazy crazy all of them .
And too , I did n't just write it just written , but also to follow .
A few months ago , and I had just forgotten everything .
But finally , I decided to God my God , I have to go to the back and these crazy .
I got up in the car , and I was really proud of Israel .
So I went to the dish .
And I thought this would be so hard , so painful .
And finally , I went from my car , and I went to the staircase .
When I was going to go back to the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and there was a older black black man who was trying to go to the trial .
When he saw me , he came back to me and said , " Who are you ? "
I said , " I 'm a lawyer . " He said , " You 're a lawyer ? " I said , " Yes . "
He came up to me and told me .
And then he gave me a ear .
He said , " I 'm so proud of you . "
And I have to say , there was my power .
It took something very deep in me , identity , the ability to each other , to try to a community , to a perspective of hope .
Well , I went back .
As soon as the judge told me .
He said , " Mr. @@UNKNOWN@@ , you asked this crazy @@UNKNOWN@@ ? "
I said , " Yeah . " And then we started talking .
Every more people came in , just because they were angry .
I wrote this crazy thing .
@@UNKNOWN@@ came in and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In the @@UNKNOWN@@ , it was full of people who were angry , that we talked about color , poverty poverty .
From my eye , I looked at the @@UNKNOWN@@ and go .
He always looked through the window , and I could hear the whole @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He went down and down .
And finally , this older black man with a very @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and she sat down behind me , almost on the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Ten minutes later , I quit the judge .
And during the moment , a @@UNKNOWN@@ in the front of it was that it was in the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This @@UNKNOWN@@ ran away from the older black .
He said , " No , what do you do in the @@UNKNOWN@@ ? "
The older black man stood on . He looked at the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and he looked at me , and he said , " I 'm going to say this young man , who you do n't accept the goal
I came up to TED , because I believe that many of you understood that the moral @@UNKNOWN@@ of the universe is far @@UNKNOWN@@ , but it should be justice .
That 's how we do n't work as humans than we do n't care about human rights and human rights .
That is our survival of survival for survival of each other .
That 's what we want to see our visions of technology and design , of entertainment and creativity , with humanity , compassion and justice .
And most of all I want to look at this , and that 's just how you just say , you do n't accept the goal .
You 've heard this in the audience , the community of the mind , and I want to help you and to do something .
What can we do ?
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ : Well , there are everywhere .
If you live in California , there 's this in a spring , where it 's about doing actually a effort to do something about the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is going to politics politics .
Here , in California , for example , in the next five years , a billion dollars a billion dollars for a death .
And yet , not @@UNKNOWN@@ percent of all of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ with a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ percent of all @@UNKNOWN@@ did n't come back .
Here 's the chance to do something .
This is going to suggest that money is more important and security .
I believe it everywhere .
While the last three decades , the @@UNKNOWN@@ in America has increased income .
This fact is often in a context with the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
What would you say someone who thinks ?
Now , in fact , the number of resistance is not changing .
Most of the @@UNKNOWN@@ in this country did n't really believe in the class of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It was the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ against drugs .
So , the consequences are very high numbers in the prison .
We have @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ from the @@UNKNOWN@@ of punishment .
Now we have three - @@UNKNOWN@@ , people who have to keep behind them on the grid , for a @@UNKNOWN@@ , for @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , which they do n't have to make the things out of the victims .
I think we need to do more people to help people who have become a victim , not less .
And I believe that our patients do n't help anyone .
I think that 's what we need to change .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , you 've really got a string to the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They 're a inspired .
Thank you for TED . Thank you very much .
Narrator : It 's an @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ with itself .
Narrator : Two years ago .
Narrator : Four @@UNKNOWN@@ . @@UNKNOWN@@ five : @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Narrator : @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Narrator : @@UNKNOWN@@ .
AK : @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ . @@UNKNOWN@@ . Egypt .
@@UNKNOWN@@ .
Oh my God .
So , these are just a few of the @@UNKNOWN@@ that I 've heard over the last six months -- it would be the last six days .
The fact is that the media is more interested in terms of what we 're talking about , because our minds look at these issues .
And there 's a very good reason for it .
Every second , we 're going to start our senses much more information than our brain can ever .
And because we do n't think more important than our survival , the first stop for all the information is a part of our immune system .
So the @@UNKNOWN@@ is our early system , our @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ the whole information on the search for all of the risks of our environment .
So if we look at the news , we prefer to look at the negative news .
And the old saying , " If it comes up , the demand is " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
Now , with all our digital devices , the most seven days of the week , 24 hours a day of all the negative news , it 's not a miracle that we 're @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's not a wonder that everybody thinks that it 's always bad .
But maybe this is not the case .
Perhaps that 's reality .
Maybe it 's a tremendous progress that we 've done in the last century through a series of forces , and so strong that it 's going to make us in the next three decades of creating a world of
Now , I do n't say we do n't have a big problems -- climate , crisis , water and energy -- we have .
And as humans , we 're much better at the problems of a very long term , but they eventually end up there .
Let 's see what we 've done in the last century , so we can predict the development .
In the last 100 years , the average life expectancy more than less than that , which has been discovered by the population of the world 's population population .
Child has a lower mortality rate .
And this is that the @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and a lot of them have a lot of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Steve Steve showed us that we 're now working in a very common time of life .
And the name of Charles @@UNKNOWN@@ is the @@UNKNOWN@@ in the last 40 years of 25 percent of 80 percent .
We live in a really extraordinary time .
And many people forget that .
And we also increase our expectations .
In fact , we have poverty .
Now think about a big percentage of Americans who live under the poverty , access to power , water , toilets , toilets , @@UNKNOWN@@ , computers , @@UNKNOWN@@ , cars and cars .
The largest example of the last century , the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the Earth , could never be able to protect these @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The basis for a lot of new technologies , and growing growing up .
My good friend of mine has shown us that every tool that 's going to be in the technology of technology , on the curve of Moore 's great @@UNKNOWN@@ , and the price of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ all 12 to
That 's why the cell phone in your pocket is about a million times less , and it 's faster faster than a @@UNKNOWN@@ from the 1970s .
Now look at this curve .
This is Moore 's the last hundred years .
Notice two things on this curve .
First of all , how do they go -- in good things like bad times , war or peace , stability and depression .
That 's the result of faster computers , even faster computers .
It does n't slow down to our big problems .
But also , despite her @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ on the left side , she 's @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So it 's changing .
And on this curve , on the back of Moore 's law , we find a series of technologies that are all available available .
" @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , something that my friends with @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , " sensors , sensors and networks , robots , 3D 3D , which allow it to create our personal production on our planet , biology
How many of you have won the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ of Watson Watson at the risk ?
That was all .
I 've made the newspapers and @@UNKNOWN@@ the best headlines that I could find .
I love this , " Watson @@UNKNOWN@@ human @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
" @@UNKNOWN@@ " is not a simple game .
It 's about the world of language .
Imagine that this artificial intelligence could be responsible for each of a leader .
So four years ago , Ray and I 'm here at TED is a new university , which is " @@UNKNOWN@@ University . "
We bring our students to all of these technologies to focus on the focus of how to use it , to solve the big challenges of humanity .
And every year we ask the students , companies , products and services , within within a decade , we can make life from billions of people .
Think about it , a group of students today , life can save life from billions of people .
About 30 years ago , this kind of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Today , we can go over several of companies that have done this .
If I think about it , I do n't mean my life , I do n't have a life of a luxury of @@UNKNOWN@@ for everyone on this planet ; it 's about me to create a life of opportunities
It 's about taking out of food goods .
It 's @@UNKNOWN@@ , and technology is a resources of power .
Here 's an example .
This is the story of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He 's the guy on the left .
He won the king of @@UNKNOWN@@ to dinner .
@@UNKNOWN@@ soldiers have been @@UNKNOWN@@ - @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ themselves .
But the king of @@UNKNOWN@@ was @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ was at the time of the metal metal on the planet , more than gold and gold .
This is the reason why the dome of the Washington @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Even though @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ percent of the energy chain , it 's not as a dirty metal .
It 's connected by oxygen and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But then the technology of @@UNKNOWN@@ was developed , and it was so cheap that we could use it with our @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Then we give this analogy to the future .
We think about @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet on the planet as much more energy than we use every year .
It 's 16 energy energy , all of 45 minutes on the surface of the surface .
It 's not about what 's the problem .
And there 's good news .
In this year , you did it for the first time to get the cost of energy in India to 50 percent of the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ -- @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in the comparison .
The cost of solar power in the last year was 50 percent .
Last month , this was a student that took a study that shows up to the end of this decade in the dark area of the United States , 10 percent per @@UNKNOWN@@ , in the size of 15 cents
And if we have a @@UNKNOWN@@ , we 're going to have water in the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Let 's talk about water wars .
Remember , as well as well , of course , the king of @@UNKNOWN@@ , 1990 , when it was Saturn Saturn , it was moving back to the Earth .
He took a famous photograph . How did it mean ?
" A @@UNKNOWN@@ Blue . "
Because we live on a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We live on a planet that has 70 percent of water with water .
Yeah , it 's @@UNKNOWN@@ percent of the average , two percent of @@UNKNOWN@@ , and we 're fighting to fight percent percent of water on the planet , but there 's also hope .
And there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
It 's new @@UNKNOWN@@ on the way , create materials .
And from a conversation today with a @@UNKNOWN@@ , one of the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , I want to share something with you -- he gave me the permission -- his @@UNKNOWN@@ , the " @@UNKNOWN@@ , " and
It can be a thousand inches of water drinking water per day from different sources -- whether it 's @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ water , @@UNKNOWN@@ -- and all the less less than two cents a mile .
The president of Coca - Cola is just @@UNKNOWN@@ , a big test project to a hundred - century developing world in the developing world .
And if everything is fine , and I 'm very optimistic , and it 's going to be Coca - Cola with this technology in global countries around the planet .
This is innovation innovation that there 's today .
And we 've seen this in cell phones .
I mean , my God , we 're going to get the 70 percent of the mobile phones from mobile phones in the developing world .
Now think about that a pair - of - a - year - old woman with a phone in the middle of Kenya , a better @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , as President president , 25 years ago .
And if they can do with their smartphone on Google , they have more access to knowledge and information as a president in the last year .
They live in a world , the information and communication , which has never ever been able to predict .
And it gets more , the things that you spend and I have thousands of thousands of dollars -- there 's @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and photograph , @@UNKNOWN@@ of books and music , technology to the medical @@UNKNOWN@@ --
And the best thing about that is what we expect in the health health .
In the last month , I had the pleasure , with the @@UNKNOWN@@ Foundation , which is more like 10 dollars of X - ray @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We need team on the whole world , all of these technologies together in a cell phone so that you can talk to the device , because it 's artificial intelligence , you can test it , or you can
And to win , it needs to be a better doctor than a team of doctors .
Imagine this device in the developing world , in the developing world , where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ percent of the public health care .
If this device has a DNA DNA or DNA virus virus , which is not known , and it 's going to @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ a pandemic out of it .
But now , the largest force that makes us to a world of wealth .
I call it " The billion billion . "
The white lines are population .
We have just @@UNKNOWN@@ the brand brand .
And by the way , the largest climate change against a population is a better food and diet in the world .
In 2010 , we only have two billion people online online .
By 2020 , we 're going to start off from two to five billion dollars .
Three billion new minds we 've never heard before we 're going to have a global conversation .
What do that need ?
What are they going to ?
And instead of @@UNKNOWN@@ , I see one of the most economic economic history .
These people represent millions of dollars dollars into the global economy .
And they 're going to get through the use of the healthier healthier , and they 're going to be able to learn more than the @@UNKNOWN@@ - @@UNKNOWN@@ , and so that they have the ability to make 3D
So what can do three billion children , healthy , productive , productive members of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
How about a sentence new , never before @@UNKNOWN@@ voices .
How would it be , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , where they are still going to give you a voice to give attention to their attention and change ?
What are these three billion people ?
How would we do with it that we ca n't even predict ?
One of the things that I learned through the X - ray , is that small team , the way of @@UNKNOWN@@ and focus is that extraordinary things can be able to create things , the great companies and governments
I want to end with a story that really really excited .
There 's a program that might be already already .
It 's a game which is called .
It was developed at the University of Washington in Seattle .
And it 's a game that 's going to be able to create a sequence of neurons that are able to study what the protein is going to develop .
The way of the behavior that we can do is structure the structure and function .
And this is very important in the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So far , this was a problem for @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And this game was played by @@UNKNOWN@@ and so forth .
And it 's hundreds of thousands of thousands of people who played the game online .
And it turns out that today , the human pattern model better the protein that makes the best @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And when these guys came up and looked at who was the best protein of the world , this was not a MIT professor , who was n't a @@UNKNOWN@@ -- it was someone from England , @@UNKNOWN@@ , a
Ladies and gentlemen , which gives me a lot of faith in our future , the fact that we have more power than individuals we have to make the big challenges of our planet .
We have access to tools with artificial technology .
We have the passion of a field - Cola .
We have the capital of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And we have three billion new minds , where we can go online with the new challenges , and to do that , what needs to do .
We expect some extraordinary decades .
Thank you .
I think that we need something to do something more about a @@UNKNOWN@@ piece of life .
And I think it 's with a medical technology and I am .
And maybe I 've been long enough in the store when I can allow it to give me a piece of my own wrong @@UNKNOWN@@ to make it possible .
But before I go to the actual issue of my talk , let 's start with a little magic .
Hey , why not ?
We 're the @@UNKNOWN@@ near and move around the world .
We all love baseball .
@@UNKNOWN@@ is a great statistics .
And there are hundreds of them .
" @@UNKNOWN@@ , " and it 's going to be statistics statistics and to use these to use a great game .
I 'm going to talk to a statistics that I hope that most of you have heard .
It 's the @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We 're talking about 300 300 than a yellow 300 .
So this means that the player 's safe from 10 to @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That means the ball into the ball , he comes down , he 's not going to kill , and who 's going to throw the ball down to the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and it did n't have been done in
Three of 10 .
You know how to call a @@UNKNOWN@@ in @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Well , really good , maybe a space star .
You know what you call a @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
This is someone who 's going to be able to get four from 10 .
@@UNKNOWN@@ - @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ like @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , who said , " during a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ during 400 times .
So let 's go back to my world in medicine , which I 'm going to talk about some more or more , or maybe a little bit less than I talked about it .
So imagine you have a @@UNKNOWN@@ , and you 'll go to a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is 400 400 years of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
How does it work , right ?
Imagine if you live in a certain remote area , and you have a nice person with @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and your family @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ to a @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is @@UNKNOWN@@ at 200 feet .
But , you know what ?
It 's a lot better . She 's on the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And she @@UNKNOWN@@ a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It does n't work .
But I 'm going to ask you a question .
What do you think about the @@UNKNOWN@@ for a @@UNKNOWN@@ or a nurse or a train , a @@UNKNOWN@@ , a @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
1,000 , very good .
The truth is that nobody in the entire medicine knows what a good surgeon or doctor should be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But what we 're doing is that we 're going to each one of you to me in the world with the perfect perfect .
It does n't make a mistake , nobody does n't think about the details of how this might be done .
And this is the message that I 'm going to be able to get into the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I was an @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ student .
In high school , you know , a @@UNKNOWN@@ said that Brian @@UNKNOWN@@ to learn a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And so it was .
And I learned some of my little @@UNKNOWN@@ in the sisters of @@UNKNOWN@@ , at the University of California , California from here .
I learned everything .
In my @@UNKNOWN@@ , I learned the origin and @@UNKNOWN@@ every @@UNKNOWN@@ , every part of a @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is from the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ and ordinary @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I even knew the @@UNKNOWN@@ to @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And I spent more and more time .
And I was good , I graduated with @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And I left the @@UNKNOWN@@ with the idea that I knew anything that I knew , or at least as much as possible as possible , as we can , I 'm going to do it today .
And it did n't work for a long time until I met a small printer .
I 'm going to be a @@UNKNOWN@@ here in Beijing than a friend of this printer to me in the hospital hospital .
And at that point , I was at the top of the top of the service service .
And it was my mission , as the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ gave me to @@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And feedback on my @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I looked at a little printer and she was in @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And when I did her , she made @@UNKNOWN@@ sound .
And when I had their chest with the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , I could hear a sound sound on both sides that he told me that she was suffering from @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This is a state in which the heart rate , instead of all of the blood vessels , and then it 's a part of the blood inside of the oxygen , and it turns down , so that the
And that was not hard to @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I asked them , and I went to treatment .
I gave her @@UNKNOWN@@ . I gave the medicine from the heart of the heart .
I gave her medicine that we call @@UNKNOWN@@ , water , so that they have the fluid @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And over a period of a two and two hours , she started to feel better .
I felt really good .
And I made my first mistake .
Actually , I made two mistakes .
I sent them home without talking to my own .
I did n't take the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I did what I 'd like to call a call at my @@UNKNOWN@@ to him with him , so that he had a chance to have a chance .
And he knew that he would be able to get more information to her .
Maybe I did .
Maybe I did n't want to be the doctor doctor .
Maybe I wanted to do so successful and so to be able to take my responsibility to me that I 'd like that , and so I would be able to try to use my patients without having to leave
My second mistake was worse .
And I sent this back home , I @@UNKNOWN@@ a quiet voice to me trying to say , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , no good idea . "
In fact , it took me very much more @@UNKNOWN@@ that I asked the nurse who wanted to leave the printer , " Do you think it 's okay if it 's home ? "
And the nurse thought about it and said , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , I think it will be good . "
I remember it was yesterday .
So I came up with the @@UNKNOWN@@ and a @@UNKNOWN@@ , and they came home .
And I went back to work .
The rest of the day I had this kind of feeling feeling in my gut .
But I worked on .
And at the end of my day , I took my things , @@UNKNOWN@@ the hospital , and I had to go into the room for the car to go home and when I was doing something I did n't
I went through the @@UNKNOWN@@ on my left home .
And there was another kid who did n't see the sister who had seen a little bit of the printer , but one another three words , and I do n't say that three words , most of the most
Some of us also fear this , but the most important thing is very , because we 're seeing the patients just like that .
The three words said , remember ?
" Do you remember the patients who go home ? "
I asked the nurse .
" So she 's back , " she told you in this particular .
So she was back .
She was back and death .
About about an hour after that , at home , after I went back home , she took her family , and the family called @@UNKNOWN@@ , and they brought back back to the @@UNKNOWN@@ with a blood of 50
It did n't barely and blue blue .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ all @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They gave her @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They came up with the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I was shocked .
And I went through this @@UNKNOWN@@ because it was after the @@UNKNOWN@@ on the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I was hoping to get them .
And after two , three days , I realized that you would never be back again .
She did n't have an @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Their family .
And in the course of the next eight or nine days , they go to the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
On the day day , they go -- -- a printer , a woman , a mother and a grandmother .
You say that you do n't name the name of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And this was the first time I learned this .
The next weeks ago , I came up with me , and I learned that the first time I did n't have the shame shame that in our medical culture -- I felt myself , but not the kind of
You all know the healthy shame , if you have a secret of the best friend , even though this is a @@UNKNOWN@@ , and you 'll get caught , and the best friend has to face it , and
If you do n't @@UNKNOWN@@ and make the mistake again .
That 's the kind of @@UNKNOWN@@ shame .
The most kind of the way I 'm talking about is that the person in the sick .
It 's the one that does n't say that what you 're doing is bad , but it 's bad .
And that was what I felt .
And it was n't the reason for my @@UNKNOWN@@ , he was very happy .
He talked to the family , and I 'm sure that he @@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ that I would n't be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But I asked these questions .
Why did n't I ask the question ? Why did I go home ?
And then in my worst moments , how could I make such a stupid mistake ?
Why did I go to medicine ?
But she also @@UNKNOWN@@ it .
I started to feel better .
And then on a @@UNKNOWN@@ day , there was a hole in the clouds , and the sun broke me , and I told me maybe I feel better .
And I was thinking that if I was going to take my effort to @@UNKNOWN@@ and never to make a mistake , that the voice would be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And she did .
And I worked on .
And then again .
Two years later , I had a service service in the room in a hospital hospital , and I met a 25 - old man with @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It was a lot , and I was in a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He showed up here .
I looked at the @@UNKNOWN@@ and it was a little bit of pink .
And I gave him a @@UNKNOWN@@ for gold and sent him .
And yet when he came from the door , he showed up on his @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Two days later , I came up to my next @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I asked myself a conversation in her office .
And she said the three words : remember what ?
" Do you remember the patients with the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ ? "
It turns out that he was a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He had an @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ disease called @@UNKNOWN@@ .
You can do that Google , but it 's not an infection of the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , but the top of the top of the top of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And fortunately he did n't die .
He got @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ a few days later .
And I went back through the same @@UNKNOWN@@ of shame and self - @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I felt @@UNKNOWN@@ and went back to the work , and again again .
In a @@UNKNOWN@@ , I have two years ago .
There 's a lot of things that especially if you think that you 're in a hospital working at that time , 14 hours per day .
In both cases , I did n't send them back home , and I did n't have any @@UNKNOWN@@ in their treatment .
And I thought it would have been @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I took the X - year - old , when it did n't have any evidence , my colleague at the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the patient 's @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ at the bottom of the right sector , and I called the
The other thing was strong .
I @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ to him him and asked my colleagues .
And that 's what he did , and he was a @@UNKNOWN@@ in the right lower sector , called the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In both cases cases , and they were fine .
Both of these cases were looking at me .
And I 'd be happy to tell you that my worst mistake only happened in the first five years ago , which many of my colleagues say , but @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in my last five years .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , shame and without support .
Here 's the problem : if I do n't close with my mistakes , and talk about them , if I can play the voice voice that tells me what 's really going to do things that I can do
How do I teach them my mistakes that they do n't write the same ?
If I was in a room room , so now I have no idea what you think about me .
When have she heard the last thing about someone who 's heard about the war talking about ?
Oh yeah , they go to a party party , and you might like to hear about any other doctor , but you 're not going to hear someone talking about your own mistakes .
If I was going to have a room full of my colleagues , and to ask their attention to the support , and I 'd like to tell them what I told you today , but I would n't really
And actually , if I or my colleagues knew that a @@UNKNOWN@@ in my hospital to get someone the wrong leg was going to be able to think of the world with my eyes .
That 's the system where we live .
It 's a completely @@UNKNOWN@@ of error .
It 's a system in which we have two basic points -- the things that make mistakes and the ones that do n't do it , and those who do n't smell and @@UNKNOWN@@ without the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and the
It 's almost one of the response response to the way that the people that people have .
And there 's the idea that if we 're trying to make the mistakes out of medicine , which is a safe system .
But there are two problems .
In my point of about 20 years of medical @@UNKNOWN@@ and terrorism , I have a personal medical study of medicine and error before we could make it all sorts of things for one of my first article that I
And what I learned is that error are absolutely important .
We 're working in a system in every day , in which one of 10 @@UNKNOWN@@ is either wrong or wrong , and it 's in the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and it 's going to be more likely to control and
In this state , about @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ were @@UNKNOWN@@ out .
In the United States , the Institute for medicine is the number of 100,000 .
We 're both right now because we do n't understand the problem , not exactly what we should be .
And this is the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In a @@UNKNOWN@@ in the medical knowledge , all of two to three years , we ca n't stop it .
@@UNKNOWN@@ is @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We ca n't get rid of it .
We have a cognitive error , so that we can make a perfect perfect for a patient with breast cancer .
And then I 'm going to take the same patient with @@UNKNOWN@@ , and it @@UNKNOWN@@ him and @@UNKNOWN@@ , and a little bit of oxygen breath , and suddenly it 's the history of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I do n't take the same course .
I 'm not a robot ; I do n't do things .
And my patients are not cars ; they 're not talking about their symptoms not always in the same way .
All of these are invisible .
So if you take the system like this , I was taught , and all of the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , then , at the end of the end , there 's no one left .
And do you know the @@UNKNOWN@@ about people who do n't talk about their worst cases ?
In my show , " @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , black way . " I have the @@UNKNOWN@@ to say , " This is my @@UNKNOWN@@ mistake , " I would have to @@UNKNOWN@@ from the @@UNKNOWN@@ until the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the
And then it turns out , they 're looking at their head , and they go down , and they get hard to start and start talking to their stories .
They want to tell your stories . They want to share their stories .
They want to be able to say , " Look , do n't the same mistake that I @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
What they need is an environment that they 're able to do it .
What they need is a new medical culture .
And it starts with a doctor .
The new core doctor is a person , knows about his humanity , but she 's not proud to make mistakes , but it 's something that you can learn to learn .
It makes their experiences with others .
They teach other people from their mistakes .
And it turns out of their own mistakes , not by @@UNKNOWN@@ , but in a @@UNKNOWN@@ , it 's so that all of them .
And she 's working in a medical culture , which is that people can make the system with life , and if it is so , people are doing mistakes of time .
So , the system that 's going to be able to make @@UNKNOWN@@ , which make it easier to make mistakes , and people can do it , and it also allow us to be able to protect the spaces
My name is Brian Brian .
I 'm the new @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I 'm a person . I make mistakes .
I 'm going to be @@UNKNOWN@@ . I 'm going to try to learn from it to learn to others .
I do n't know what you do for me , but I can live .
Let me end with three of my own words : I remember .
I 'm going to talk about a little bit , little idea .
It 's about @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And because you can explain this idea in a minute , I 'll tell you about three stories about the time .
The first story is Charles Darwin , one of my heroes .
You probably know that he was here .
They may think that he @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , but that 's not true .
It actually actually fish fish .
He described one of them as a result . "
It was a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
By the ' 80s , in the ' 80s , he became a lot of sand .
Now he 's on the red list .
This story has a lot of times of the corals , or from other places , they 're not very special .
However , we still have to go to the Galapagos .
We still think they 're at the beginning .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ may describe it as though .
What happened here ?
The second story is to take another idea , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Because I 've experienced it when I grew up in the West in West Africa .
I went there , because I grew up in Europe , and I wanted to work in Africa .
I thought I could .
And I got a bad note , and I convinced that I really did n't really believe from there .
It was my first @@UNKNOWN@@ .
As you see , the @@UNKNOWN@@ from the top of them , and from a few of the trees .
There were a few years ago , 20 inches , a @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ of these @@UNKNOWN@@ were very low , and the fish lived well and they were pretty good at India .
When I was 27 years later , it was the fish on half of its size .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ five .
They were genes .
It was still fish .
People were still happy .
And the fish had also been lucky to be there .
So it has n't changed , and yet it changed everything .
My third story story of my @@UNKNOWN@@ at the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ in Asia .
In the ' 70s -- more to the early ' 60s -- Europe Europe .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , in the countries that have been 100,000 100,000 fish , the industrial fish , which was quite ugly , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I went with it , and we made it up in the middle of the south of sea sea and especially in the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We had no words for what we started .
I know that it 's the reason of the sea .
90 percent of us were @@UNKNOWN@@ , other animals that are connected to the reason .
The largest part of the fish , the small dots there are on the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the coral coral , fish fish fish .
And basically , the reason of the sea was on the deck , and then it turned out .
These images are extraordinary , because the transition is very fast .
Within a year , you 're going to take a survey through , and it starts with the fish fish .
The reason is changing . @@UNKNOWN@@ -- in this case -- there 's a hard reason or it 's going to be coral corals .
This is a dead dead .
They were n't going to eat away , because they were dead .
Once we started a living alive .
She was n't @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Then they 'd kill them , because you could eat them well .
In fact , this mountain of @@UNKNOWN@@ every day of @@UNKNOWN@@ , when they 're going to move into areas where they never have gone .
It does n't happen .
We change the world , but we do n't remember it .
We 're going to put our @@UNKNOWN@@ on the new level , and we 're not in our memory , which was there .
If you do it , it happens .
On the top - axis , a few good things : biodiversity , the number of @@UNKNOWN@@ , the green of the country , the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
With the time , it changed . It 's changing because the people are their action .
Every generation are looking at the images that they 're starting to start to see their behavior , as the standard and it 's all of it .
The difference is more than loss .
But they do n't expect the same loss .
It can give an order of change .
And at the end of you , you just want to leave the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That 's exactly what our goal now .
We want to get things that have gone or things that are not more like they were .
You might think that the problem of humans , who are sure when they were in @@UNKNOWN@@ societies , animals were killed and a few generations to see what they did .
Because obviously it 's a animal that it was very often there , even once times before .
So you do n't lose a lot of animals .
You always lose two animals .
And that 's not going to be a loss loss .
With the time we focus on the big animals and the ocean , the big fish fish .
They 're going to get less because we start .
With the time , there 's fish fish and we think that 's the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The question is , why do people accept it .
Now , because they do n't know that it was different .
Of course , lots of people , scientists , they were really different .
They 're going to tell you , because the evidence , as they 're in a former form of @@UNKNOWN@@ , are not like you like to prove the evidence .
There 's an example that the report of a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , in the area of this area , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , is n't used to be used , or not @@UNKNOWN@@ , because it 's not going to be
So we have the situation that the people do n't know the past , even though we live in social societies , because they do n't understand the sources of the past .
And this is a huge amount of role that play an urban play .
Because I do n't go back to urban areas .
We 're looking at the past again that people ca n't understand the way that they have changed , and very low .
And so that people can see a urban area , and the value of the way that it allows to make their @@UNKNOWN@@ .
What about people who do n't do that , because they do n't have access access -- people are in the Middle East ?
So here , I think , art and the film may be the gap , and you can .
This is the simulation of the Bay Bay .
A long time ago , there was @@UNKNOWN@@ -- 500 years ago .
And the @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ , you may remember , "
If you think of " @@UNKNOWN@@ , " if you think about why people were so touched by the @@UNKNOWN@@ story , why were they touched by the @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
Because it was something that was made in some sense .
So my favorite , the only thing that I 'm going to give is , in the case , he 's called " @@UNKNOWN@@ II . "
Thank you very much .
In the ' 80s , in the 1970s , you had to be able to do when you had a @@UNKNOWN@@ , which was in the government .
They also had to have a piece of @@UNKNOWN@@ from this @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The reason for this : the government could go back , where a text came from .
@@UNKNOWN@@ them an article with @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and they were able to find the @@UNKNOWN@@ of this thought .
And we were not able to understand how anyone could do something , and how much it would be free .
In our own countries , we never do something .
But if you 're going to buy a new @@UNKNOWN@@ from the third - year - year - old @@UNKNOWN@@ , and a piece of paper , there 's the side of the yellow yellow @@UNKNOWN@@ on every side of
That 's happening today .
And it seems to anyone nobody .
And this was an example , in the way that our own governments are helping us against our citizens .
And this is one of three three - of - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - term -
Let 's look at what 's really happening in the world : We can go back into categories .
We have three @@UNKNOWN@@ .
There are online criminals .
For example , this is Mr. @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ from @@UNKNOWN@@ in @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And the @@UNKNOWN@@ of online @@UNKNOWN@@ are very easy to understand .
These people make money .
They use online @@UNKNOWN@@ to make a lot of money to make a huge amount of money .
There are several known cases of online @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , who have their money through @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This is @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This is @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This is Chris Anderson , @@UNKNOWN@@ Al @@UNKNOWN@@ and so forth .
These people have been online online wealth , but they 've done it , but they 've done it by @@UNKNOWN@@ , like @@UNKNOWN@@ , to make money from our @@UNKNOWN@@ , as we put our online online , or
The U.S. - American intelligence system for two months ago , the Swiss - @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of Mr. @@UNKNOWN@@ here is an @@UNKNOWN@@ , and on this site , @@UNKNOWN@@ million million dollars , when it was frozen .
Mr. @@UNKNOWN@@ itself is on its foot , which is fascinating .
And I 'm going to argue that it 's more likely that we 're going to be victims of an online crime than a crime in the real world .
And it 's very obvious that this is just worse .
In the future , most of these online online .
The second @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ that we can see today is not using money .
They 're inspired by something else .
groups like @@UNKNOWN@@ are over over the last 12 months , and they 're in one of the @@UNKNOWN@@ on the site of the online @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So these are the three @@UNKNOWN@@ : criminals , who do it from the money , because of how @@UNKNOWN@@ , the way of the resistance , but the last group of countries , governments , who are going to
There we are , like , from the way .
It turns out what happens when governments do their own citizens .
@@UNKNOWN@@ is a @@UNKNOWN@@ from the Netherlands -- or not .
In the last fall , it had to be @@UNKNOWN@@ , because it was @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Someone was @@UNKNOWN@@ and had the system .
And last week , at a meeting with @@UNKNOWN@@ , I asked one of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group
And his answer was " Yes . "
Now , how do people die in the end of this ?
@@UNKNOWN@@ is a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They sell them .
What do you do with @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
Now , a @@UNKNOWN@@ takes you to take a website with @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , for example .
Now , we use all of them , or many of us , or not their own work , but these services are very popular in the United States like the Iran , where @@UNKNOWN@@ are anonymous as well as
Can they go , but if they were in a foreign state .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And that 's exactly what happens in the way .
How does it go through the Arab spring and the things that I 've seen in Egypt ?
Now , Egypt in the Egypt in the 2011 of 2011 , the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ Center , and they found a lot of them .
In this slide , a @@UNKNOWN@@ called " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
And in this one , there were notes on a book in Germany in the United States , who had the government government had a few programs that they had -- in a very large scale -- all of the
They had this program for @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ to the British government .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ is exactly here .
So , the governments of governments governments governments with governments to do it against their own citizens .
But Western governments also help themselves .
For example in Germany , a few weeks ago , we called the @@UNKNOWN@@ . This was a @@UNKNOWN@@ who used to be a German group of their own citizens .
If you 're going to be @@UNKNOWN@@ in a @@UNKNOWN@@ , it 's going to be very clear to your phone .
But today we 're beyond beyond .
They @@UNKNOWN@@ your Internet .
They use tools like the @@UNKNOWN@@ , to use your computer with a @@UNKNOWN@@ , which allows them to allow your entire communication to your online @@UNKNOWN@@ , your @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So if we think about these things , then the obvious answer of the people , " OK , that sounds bad , but it 's not wrong , because I 'm a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I do n't have to worry .
I do n't hide anything . "
And this argument makes no sense .
@@UNKNOWN@@ has to be .
@@UNKNOWN@@ does n't matter .
It 's no choice between privacy and security .
It 's a choice between freedom and control .
And as we 're today , in 2011 , our government , including governments , but we are all right , which we 're trying to keep on it .
And we trust that we can blind blind one of the future of government , a government that we might have in 50 years ago ?
These are the questions that we need to do with the next 50 years .
It may be weird , but I 'm a big fan of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The first @@UNKNOWN@@ were made of @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ a simple idea : @@UNKNOWN@@ from the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the fit together .
@@UNKNOWN@@ were very fast - @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in the world .
They gave us to build things that were larger than we building buildings , a rock after the other .
In fact , the @@UNKNOWN@@ was built in the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the building .
Almost a hundred years later , in Brazil , came up with this .
It was called " @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
And within less years , moved in every house .
It 's going to say that about 400 billion rocks were made of " @@UNKNOWN@@ or " @@UNKNOWN@@ " for every person on this planet .
You do n't have to be an engineer , to make beautiful houses , beautiful buildings , beautiful buildings or beautiful buildings .
@@UNKNOWN@@ did it for all .
@@UNKNOWN@@ has basically @@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the world , and it made a building for our imagination .
In the moment , in the same year , after the next revolution , the next revolution was going to be the next group .
The king was a little bit of @@UNKNOWN@@ that the world from us in the world , the building , @@UNKNOWN@@ buildings into a world in all of it .
How about the @@UNKNOWN@@ that allows us to make much more more complex and more complex , more complex than build a rock .
But there 's a @@UNKNOWN@@ : The gold was only for experts .
I mean , that does n't mean that the @@UNKNOWN@@ of our time for experts and I decided to change it .
eight years ago , I was at the MIT Lab , and I started this idea of how to create the power of engineers in the hand of artists and designers .
Now , a few years ago , I began to develop .
Let me show you how they work .
@@UNKNOWN@@ are electronic games that have a specific function .
They 're @@UNKNOWN@@ , light , @@UNKNOWN@@ , engine and light .
And the best part of it is to connect them together .
So you ca n't walk around it .
The rocks are @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Green is @@UNKNOWN@@ , blue is electricity , pink is @@UNKNOWN@@ and blue is @@UNKNOWN@@ .
All you need to do is , and a blue and a green and you can create a very fast @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They add a blue on a green , and they can make light .
You can make a switch and make it a little @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Take the switch out to a @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is here , @@UNKNOWN@@ , and you have a little @@UNKNOWN@@ .
If you put this @@UNKNOWN@@ for an object effect , and you made a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I 'm going to stop that .
Over the simple play , it 's quite quite powerful .
Instead of thinking that you 're going to program , or @@UNKNOWN@@ , you have to do with you , you can do simple with simple , simple components .
So , to make it faster and faster , you just click on this button , and it makes the faster faster or faster .
The idea behind it is that it 's a growing library .
We want every individual interaction in this world in a @@UNKNOWN@@ rock .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , sound , @@UNKNOWN@@ , motors -- everything should be available .
We have @@UNKNOWN@@ people children and play them with it .
And it was an incredible experience .
The nice thing is , how do you start to have the electronics , who they learn in the world , and they do n't learn in school .
For example , for example , a @@UNKNOWN@@ works , or why the door of the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , or like a iPod on touch .
We also have @@UNKNOWN@@ also .
So , for example , we wanted to have a lot of experience with electronic experience that were starting to play with material material .
So here , we see , with @@UNKNOWN@@ , paper and water , like @@UNKNOWN@@ ...
A few weeks ago , we have @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and we gave them a lot of designers , who have n't had a technical experience -- just @@UNKNOWN@@ , wood and paper -- and they said , " power
Here 's an example of a project that they did , a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But wait , this is really my favorite project .
It 's a @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ , the fear in the darkness .
For those of these engineers , it became a more material , electronics , and just a little material .
And we want to create this material for all .
So , open open source .
They can go to the website , all of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and they create themselves .
We want to make the world of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the artist , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the world that we live in these interactive world ,
So , go up and start off .
Thank you very much .
You know , one of the big @@UNKNOWN@@ in the travel , and one of the @@UNKNOWN@@ at the research research is to live with the people who are still learning to the old days .
It 's the idea that @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ still still go beyond the middle of the galaxy , or the meaning of the history of the Muslims who are still full of meaning , or , in the Himalayas , the
And of course , we share all the same @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We 're born to be born . We bring children to the world .
We go through @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We need to @@UNKNOWN@@ with us from the death through the death , and so it should n't surprise us that we 're all dancing and dancing and art .
But interesting is the unique note of the sound , the rhythm of the light in each culture .
In fact , it does n't matter whether it 's about the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in the forests of forests , or the @@UNKNOWN@@ , in Haiti , or the @@UNKNOWN@@ in the @@UNKNOWN@@ desert of @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ in
All of these people teach us that there are other different ways of other ways , other ways of looking at the Earth .
And this is an idea that if you think about it , just one with hope .
And together , the cultures of cultures in the world of a web of @@UNKNOWN@@ and life life , which is the Earth , and for the most of the Earth 's important , as the biological @@UNKNOWN@@ , you
You can think of this cultural @@UNKNOWN@@ as a @@UNKNOWN@@ , and it can be able to think about the full of all of the minds and dreams , great ideas , @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ that the human imagination have
The @@UNKNOWN@@ is this great legacy of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we 're doing , and what we 're known as an @@UNKNOWN@@ species .
And the same way that the @@UNKNOWN@@ was strong , and this happened with the @@UNKNOWN@@ -- just the same speed .
No one would say , for example , to say that 50 percent or more of the species that we 've seen is that it 's not true . And yet , this -- the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the diversity of
And the key thing for this is the tragic of languages .
When every one of you were born in this room , we were talking to the Earth languages .
Now , a language is not only the whole of the pollen or a series of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
A language is expression of human mind .
It 's a way to deal with the soul of a certain culture in the material world .
Every language is like a @@UNKNOWN@@ forest of the mind , a moment , an idea , an idea , an ecosystem ecosystem .
And from those babies , today , we 're sitting here in Monterey , which are not half of them in the ears of children .
They 're not going to learn a little bit more than that . It does n't mean if anything is going to be done , they 're actually dead .
What could possibly be more than silence silence , one of the last one of the people who are going to talk to your language language , not have a chance to have the wisdom of the ancestors , or
And yet , this terrible story of someone else somewhere on the Earth , about the two weeks , because every two weeks , a older person , and that 's the last @@UNKNOWN@@ of a old language .
And I know that some of you say , " Is n't it better ? "
Let 's say . "
And then suddenly you realize how it would be if you could do your language language .
That 's why I 'm going to take you through a journey with the @@UNKNOWN@@ , a short journey through the @@UNKNOWN@@ to try to make you understand what 's actually lost .
Now there are some of us that I do n't forget when I say , " different ways of being , " @@UNKNOWN@@ different ways of my own .
Take the example of the kid of the @@UNKNOWN@@ in the West of the Amazon , the people of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , believe that they @@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ from the East in the south of sacred @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This is a group which is not going to be different between the red , and green , which is the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the forest , which is the people who is @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They have a @@UNKNOWN@@ language and a @@UNKNOWN@@ called the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and you have to get someone married , another one language .
All of this in the past past the past past , the @@UNKNOWN@@ of these great homes , which is because of the @@UNKNOWN@@ of six or seven languages , which is , you know , you do n't ever
They 're just going to talk and start .
Or , one of the most tribes tribes that I 've ever lived , the @@UNKNOWN@@ in the middle of Muslims , an amazing people who were first in the year - old @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In the last year , I started five to touch with @@UNKNOWN@@ and made a mistake .
And they took pictures of photos from the air , which we would think as a human desire , and forget it that these people out of the forest in their lives never had seen something else .
They took these photos out of the forest , trying to see the face or found the character , and there was no things and @@UNKNOWN@@ that this would be the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the brain , and killed the five
But the @@UNKNOWN@@ did n't just die with the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They @@UNKNOWN@@ each other .
@@UNKNOWN@@ percent of death died through @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We looked at the eight eight generations of time , and we found two cases of natural natural , and when we met the people with a little bit about it , and then they were killed that one of
But at the same time , they had a clear idea of the forest that was extraordinary .
They were able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to control the animal of the animal from 40 steps , and they
In the early early years , I got a really incredible job when I was going to write my professor at Harvard , whether I was interested interested in Haiti , and the political societies too , the foundation of
So in order to make sense of that point , I had to think of something about this remarkable remarkable of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I 'm not a @@UNKNOWN@@ of the black magic .
In the opposite , it 's about a complex story .
It 's interesting .
So if I ask you , the big world would be thinking about what would you say ?
@@UNKNOWN@@ , Islam , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ or whatever .
A continent is going to leave out , because the idea was that there was a lot of poverty in religious religious . Of course , there was one of them , and it 's just the @@UNKNOWN@@ of this
But what 's going to do so interesting , this is the relationship between the living and the dead .
The birth birth to the minds .
The minds can come from under the Great water @@UNKNOWN@@ , who respond to the rhythm of the dance , to see the soul of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , so that the @@UNKNOWN@@ for a short - term moment to God
@@UNKNOWN@@ like to say , " You know , the white is going to the church and talk about God .
We dance in the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and we become God . "
And because you 're obsessed , you 're going to get out of the spirit . How can you do it damage ?
If you look at this amazing @@UNKNOWN@@ : @@UNKNOWN@@ - @@UNKNOWN@@ in a @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ of coal without coal @@UNKNOWN@@ , an amazing idea of the ability to see the body of the body so that it would
Now , from all of the people who I met , they were the @@UNKNOWN@@ from the French @@UNKNOWN@@ in @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ from the old @@UNKNOWN@@ civilization , the @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ , in the end of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , this country in a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is about @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In a continent continent , these people were only the only ones that never had ever been @@UNKNOWN@@ .
By the day today , they 're going to be a part - of - @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ . The education is also very extraordinary .
The young generation will be in the age of three and four years from their families , and in a @@UNKNOWN@@ world of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , in @@UNKNOWN@@ on the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the ice for 18 years , two years
And while this whole time , you 're going to end up in the values of their society , values , which makes the claim that their dad and only their dad , the origami -- or we could say
And at the end of this incredible story , she 's one day , and suddenly , and the first time in their lives , in the age of 18 years , they see a @@UNKNOWN@@ . And in this
It 's so wonderful . You need to protect it . "
They call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world .
Now this level of intuition is very important .
And when we think about @@UNKNOWN@@ and landscape , we 're either @@UNKNOWN@@ and the old @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is in the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , or other , and say , these people are more
So , @@UNKNOWN@@ are not @@UNKNOWN@@ , and they 're going to be from @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It does n't have a lot of space for the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ or cold cold , of course , but yet , through time and @@UNKNOWN@@ a @@UNKNOWN@@ of the Earth that does n't look at the idea
Now , what does that mean ?
It means that a little kid from the future that 's going to be in the belief that the mountain is a @@UNKNOWN@@ spirit , which is or your destiny is going to be a very different person , and
Whether he 's a @@UNKNOWN@@ of a mind or a whole bunch of @@UNKNOWN@@ , it 's wrong .
The interesting is the metaphor , the relationship between the individual and the nature .
I grew up in the forests of @@UNKNOWN@@ , and believed that these forests are going to be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Which made me to another person than my friends under the @@UNKNOWN@@ who believe that the forests of the forests of @@UNKNOWN@@ and the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and the @@UNKNOWN@@ spirit , the most popular world of the world , the
Now , if you start to understand the idea that these cultures are different cultures can be able to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries .
It 's a photograph that I just last last April in the Amazon of the Amazon .
This is @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is a lot of you heard about the most powerful @@UNKNOWN@@ from the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So what 's fascinating about this is not just the @@UNKNOWN@@ potential of this @@UNKNOWN@@ , but it 's really @@UNKNOWN@@ out of two different sources .
This plant has some very strong @@UNKNOWN@@ of the behavior , @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
If you 've seen the @@UNKNOWN@@ , you know how they do this stuff , the substance that they can produce from different species .
This is a little bit more like this from a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ from @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and the @@UNKNOWN@@ on a sea of electricity .
It 's not going to leave the reality of reality , but the resolution of reality .
In fact , I was talking with my professor , Richard King @@UNKNOWN@@ , the guy who 's @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ with the discovery of the magic @@UNKNOWN@@ in Mexico in the @@UNKNOWN@@ of years , and I said that you
But the thing with @@UNKNOWN@@ is that it 's not going to be @@UNKNOWN@@ , because it 's through a @@UNKNOWN@@ in the human smell of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ with @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They can only be able to connect with some other chemicals that are @@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Now , the fascinating thing is that the @@UNKNOWN@@ , which are in the @@UNKNOWN@@ , are @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is exactly the way that needs to be able to use the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
How can these people come from one of thousands of species species of plants plants , two of these plants do n't grow plants , plants , when , in this way , a kind of @@UNKNOWN@@ version that it
We 're using this great @@UNKNOWN@@ , trying and error , which turns out .
But you ask the Indian Indian people say , " This is a plant .
So what does that mean ?
This tribe , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , have 17 inches of @@UNKNOWN@@ , which they all look at the amount of water in the forest where the eyes are like a form .
And then you ask them how they say their @@UNKNOWN@@ , and they say , " I thought about something about plants .
I mean , you know nothing ? " And I said , " No . "
So , it turns out that you can save each of the 17 feet in @@UNKNOWN@@ , and they sing them in a different range .
Now , this does n't give you a doctor at Harvard , but it 's much more interesting than @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Now , the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the problem is that even those of us who feel the way for the hard ones that they have as @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ , but they 're kind of looking at the past , while
So , in fact , you can think about the 20 century , in 300 years , not for his wars or technical innovations , but more than an era , where we were @@UNKNOWN@@ and the massive destruction of
All of cultures have always come back to the dance with new @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indian Indians do n't have less less than @@UNKNOWN@@ , when they came up , and they 'll be able to say that as Americans were Americans , as they were dead and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Not like technology and technology , which is the most important thing about it . It 's power .
And you can see in the world where you 're going to discover that these cultures are not the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the world . These are dangerous living people living their existence through their forces through the @@UNKNOWN@@ of their
Or if we go into the mountains of Tibet , where I get a lot of research , you 'll see the ugly face of political political .
You know , the genocide , the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of people will be very popular , but the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the destruction of the world , which is not just @@UNKNOWN@@ , but it 's just a part of a
And you ca n't understand the suffering , if you do n't see it at @@UNKNOWN@@ level .
I 've been met with a young colleague of thousands of thousands of @@UNKNOWN@@ in @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ by @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and when I saw after the last year , I saw the face of the statistics that you hear
The father of young young became became the @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It meant that he killed during the Chinese @@UNKNOWN@@ .
His grandmother , with her @@UNKNOWN@@ , who brought people to Nepal .
His mother became @@UNKNOWN@@ as a punishment for -- for the crime .
He was in the age of two years ago in prison , and she 's under her @@UNKNOWN@@ to hide , without she could n't live with him .
The sister , the fact , the fact , actually , was in a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
One day she @@UNKNOWN@@ out of a @@UNKNOWN@@ , and he had to @@UNKNOWN@@ them for seven years in a prison camp .
The suffering can be @@UNKNOWN@@ , but the @@UNKNOWN@@ spirit of human beings is something @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And at the end , we really want us to do a choice . Do we want to live in a @@UNKNOWN@@ world of @@UNKNOWN@@ or the world in a world world ?
For example , the big woman said before she died that it 's their greatest fear that we 're moving in the direction of a @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , we do n't only have the whole range of human
And it 's @@UNKNOWN@@ to think that our species may have been over there .
The revolution revolution that brought us from agriculture , and we 're in this moment of the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the poetry of the @@UNKNOWN@@ through the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ --
The modern industrial world as we know it is not 300 years old .
Now , this story story does n't tell me that we all have the answers to the challenges we 're going to go back to the University of thousands .
If we 're going to have this @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of the meaning of the human question , they ask them with 10,000 different voices .
And in this song we 're going to be able to be able to be the possibility of what we are : people with conscious minds that are important to realize that all people and @@UNKNOWN@@ can have a space
Here 's a photograph that I 'm at the end of the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , when I was @@UNKNOWN@@ with the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and this guy , @@UNKNOWN@@ , told me a wonderful story .
The government government is not always very good with the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and during the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the course of the course of our @@UNKNOWN@@ , they were forced to make them .
The grandfather of this old man .
The family , the fear of his life , took him all the time and all the tools .
Now you have to know that people are not afraid of the cold . They used to use their advantage .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ of their @@UNKNOWN@@ were built from fish , which was in @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ skin .
The grandfather of the man of @@UNKNOWN@@ was not talking about the ice @@UNKNOWN@@ or the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He @@UNKNOWN@@ out out of his @@UNKNOWN@@ from @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ in his hand , and when the @@UNKNOWN@@ , he started in a form .
He @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ on the pages of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and it was completely frozen , @@UNKNOWN@@ him a dog .
He @@UNKNOWN@@ the dog and @@UNKNOWN@@ a @@UNKNOWN@@ , took the skeleton of the dog and @@UNKNOWN@@ a @@UNKNOWN@@ , a little dog on the @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ about the @@UNKNOWN@@ with the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So you can do something .
And this is many ways of a symbol of the resistance , and all of us in the world .
The government government gave the @@UNKNOWN@@ in the 1999 in 1999 , which is an open control over a area that 's bigger than California and Texas .
It 's our new country and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's an independent area . They control all of them .
Now , an amazing example , like a nation , a state that can do with their people and can do it .
And finally , I think it 's quite obvious , at least for those of us who are moving away from the rise of the Earth , which is that they 're not missing .
They 're the @@UNKNOWN@@ of someone .
They represent parts of the human imagination , in the past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children are part of the ignorance of hope .
So what we 're going to do with National Geographic is that we believe that we 're never going to do something .
We believe that @@UNKNOWN@@ -- we do n't believe that @@UNKNOWN@@ is not necessarily , but we believe that the world can change the world , and we 're probably going to be able to find the best institution for
@@UNKNOWN@@ nations are @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Our books are written by millions .
And we 're going to do a series of travel in the world where we 're going to meet our audience in places like this cultural wonder that they 're going to be from the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and hopefully ,
Thank you very much .
What I 'm going to show you quickly , as fast as possible , we 're going to show the basic work , a new technology that we 're Microsoft as a part of a @@UNKNOWN@@ in a year ,
We see a lot of a lot of digital data on the photos , and we 're going to take a whole process , and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , in any way .
And it does n't matter how much information we 're looking at , how big these data are or how big the images are .
Most of them are digital pictures of a camera , but this one here is an example of the Congress and it 's in a area of 300 @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It does n't make any difference , because the only thing that the performance of a system like this is that the number of you can be on your screen in every moment . It also has a very small
This is a whole book , an example of @@UNKNOWN@@ data .
This is @@UNKNOWN@@ House of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In order to prove that it really does a text and not to see a picture , we can do something like this , to show that this is a real representation of @@UNKNOWN@@ and no image .
Maybe this is an artificial way to read a book book .
I would n't recommend it .
This is a @@UNKNOWN@@ case . This is a copy of the Times .
Every big image is the beginning of a game .
And this gives you really the pleasure and the good experience of a real @@UNKNOWN@@ of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of medium with a lot of scales .
We also have something in the corner of this particular issue of the Times .
We 've created a wrong article with very high - resolution , which is much higher than in a normal product , and we have more content content .
If you want to have the functions of this car , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even technical technologies .
And this really really makes these ideas on these markets for the open space on the screen .
We hope that this is not @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and other @@UNKNOWN@@ is more than that should n't be necessary .
Of course , this is one of the really important applications for a technology like this .
And I do n't want to spend a lot of time , except to say that we 're also going to be in this area .
But these are all the streets in the United States .
@@UNKNOWN@@ up on the @@UNKNOWN@@ image of NASA .
So let 's do something else .
Now this is actually live in the Internet . You can do it .
This is a project called the name , which is really two different technologies together .
One of them is , and the other one is a very good research on @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , at a University of the University of Washington , which is by the @@UNKNOWN@@ of Steve @@UNKNOWN@@
And Rick @@UNKNOWN@@ from Microsoft research was a very good collaboration .
So this is live in the Internet . It 's going to be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
You can see that if we can create these kinds of ideas that we can get through images and have the experience of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But the actual structure of the images here are actually important .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ algorithms have these pictures together , so they have the real space , in the images that are all in the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and you can see some parts of
I do n't know exactly if I have time to show you other environments .
There are some who are much more .
I 'd like to show you at the beginning of the film of thousands of years , and this is from a early prototype of @@UNKNOWN@@ that we 've been working at the summer of the way to show you
We had to worry about the government , etc .
This is a @@UNKNOWN@@ of the middle of the lady , which is all in the computer with pictures of photos . They give you a little woman in the photos , and you 're going to be pictures of
So these are all pictures of images , and all of them are in the way that relationship with each other .
And we can do this very simple way .
You know , I never believed that I 'm going to work at Microsoft .
I 'm very grateful for the @@UNKNOWN@@ here .
I guess you can see that this is a lot different kinds of cameras , which is all of the cell phone phone , a very large number of them that were all in this environment .
And if possible , I 'll find some of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Many of them are their faces , etc .
There 's a number of photographs -- here .
In fact , this is actually a poster of @@UNKNOWN@@ lady , which was right .
We can move from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
The point here is that we can do things with the social environment , and it 's going to be data from all of this -- from the collective collective memory , like , visual , the Earth -- and
All of these photos are connected , and it 's something that 's larger than the amount of parts .
They get a model that comes from all the Earth .
So think of this as the paradigm of the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ of modern @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And this is something that looks through the complexity , with the people use it , and the amount of the use for the user can be bigger .
They 're taking their own photos , which has a different person .
If someone has been able to do that , and all of these @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ who who are all , then I 'm going to photograph my photograph of the @@UNKNOWN@@ -- and suddenly you can use it
And , of course , all of these are the great ways of virtual worlds of any interesting part of the Earth that are not just through @@UNKNOWN@@ or satellite and so forth , but by collective memory .
Thank you very much .
What do I do ? You know , your software can imagine that in a particular time , in the next few years , all the images that people can be used by someone in the world in order to
Yeah . She does n't do anything than anything .
If you want to make it from between the images .
And she does this because of the content in the images .
And this is really exciting when you think about the amount of information that you can think about many of these images .
How if you take a @@UNKNOWN@@ of images , where you can see sentences and the text of the website , there 's a lot of information about what the image is .
But how would it mean if you look at all your images ?
Then it 's the scale of the @@UNKNOWN@@ and the amount of light that makes sense of it , and it 's a classic @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , this is really incredible .
Thank you very much .
I 'm going to tell you some things from my book , which I hope , in terms of other things , you 've heard you , and I 'm going to try to make some kind of connections if
I want to start with what I call " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
That 's what we call from what ?
The @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of natural Western societies .
This is what we call it , which is , if our goal of the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the citizens of our citizens , this is all about the @@UNKNOWN@@ of freedom .
The reason for this is that freedom in itself is good , valuable , makes a sense of collective human .
If people have freedom , it 's every one of us for us to do things that we need to do , and our choice has to decide .
The way to make freedom is choice .
The more choices people have , the more freedom , and the more freedom they have , the more greater we have .
This is , I think , deep deep in our water supply , that there 's no way in the sense of thinking .
And it 's also deep in our lives .
I 'm going to give you some examples of what I think about modern modern progress .
This is my supermarket . No big .
I just want to talk about something about saying .
There 's a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in my supermarket , if you can save the 10 different extra @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ , and 12 @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , you could buy a lot of a very large amount of @@UNKNOWN@@ in the
So this is , like the supermarket .
And then you go to the consumers of electronics electronics to make a @@UNKNOWN@@ -- @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ players , a @@UNKNOWN@@ player , radio , @@UNKNOWN@@ , and in this one - year - old store there are so
We can @@UNKNOWN@@ millions of different components of the components that are produced in this store .
You have to admit that this is a great choice .
In other areas -- the world of communication .
There was a time when I was a boy , because you could have a phone phone that you wanted to hear it as long as he came from @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They did your phone phone . They did n't buy it .
One thing that the phone was never broken .
These days are over .
We have almost an infinite choice of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
These are the mobile phones .
My favorite is in the middle -- @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ - @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And if you do n't have seen in your business , you can be sure you 'll be soon .
And what it does is to make people in the business , and this question .
You know what the answer to this question is ?
The answer is no .
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that does n't buy a lot .
In other parts of the life that are very much more important than the @@UNKNOWN@@ of objects , the same amount of the choice .
@@UNKNOWN@@ -- it 's not longer the case of the United States in the United States , and the doctor will tell you what to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor and the doctor , you know , we could do A -- or we could make B .
A has these benefits and risks .
B has these benefits and risks . What do you want to do ?
And you say , " doctor , what do I do ? "
The doctor says , A has this benefits and risks and B has the benefits and risks .
What do you want to do ?
And if you say , " If you would be , doctor , what would you do ? "
The doctor says , " But I 'm not . "
The result is -- we call it a patient 's lost , and that sounds like a good thing , but in the reality , it 's a shift of the patient -- that 's a good thing , but
There 's a lot of marketing marketing for drugs for people like you , and I think that if you think about it , even no sense , because we do n't buy it .
Why do you buy if we ca n't buy it ?
The answer is , you expect us to win the doctor 's next morning , and to ask a change for the answer .
A little bit like our identity is a question of choice to show this slide .
We do n't have identity , we make them .
And we 're going to invent so many ways we want .
That means that every day when you go to the morning , you have to decide what a kind of person you want to be .
In terms of marriage and family , there was a time in terms of the standard -- it was almost every one of them , and then you had so fast , as well as you could , and then
The only thing was , " who said , " and not what they did .
Today , it 's just too .
I teach wonderful smart students , and I give them 20 percent less work than I did .
And that 's not because you 're very smart , and not because they 're less carefully .
It 's because they 're doing other things with them , and they ask yourself , " Do I want to be married or not ? Should I am now ?
Should I go back to you ? Should I have only children children , or do I do ? "
These are all sorts of questions .
And they 're going to answer these questions , whether it means all of the tasks that I 'm going to do with you and not a good note in my mind .
And in fact , they should do this . This is important to ask questions .
The work -- we 're lucky , like Carl @@UNKNOWN@@ , who can allow us to wait every minute of every day of every day on every planet .
There 's a corner where I 'm not going to tell you the work .
I 'm not going to tell you because I want to use it .
So what it means is this incredible freedom of choice that we have to do in our work , and again again , and again , whether we do n't want to work or not work .
We can play our children with play play , and we have our cell phone on a hip , and our @@UNKNOWN@@ on others , and our laptop is probably on our birth .
And also , if they 're all @@UNKNOWN@@ , every minute in the child , we 're going to @@UNKNOWN@@ our child at the @@UNKNOWN@@ of a @@UNKNOWN@@ , we ask us , " Should I call this call ?
Should I answer this email ? Should I write this letter ?
And also , if the answer to the question , " No , " is it going to be your experience of the child 's life so much different than it .
So where we live , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
And the world lived in the world .
And I want to say , there were some choices , but not all the question was .
And the world in the world now looks like this .
And the question is , is good or bad news ?
The answer is yes .
We all know what 's good about what I 'm going to do about that is bad .
All of these choice have two effects , two negative effects on people .
The effect , in a way , is that he does n't take it .
With a lot of options , you can choose that it 's very hard to decide .
So , I 'm going to give you another example of an example of a study that investment in investment .
One of my colleague of mine had access to @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ from @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of about a million workers and about 2,000 different parts .
And what she found was 10 10 years ago , which led to the @@UNKNOWN@@ to two percent .
They spend 50 percent in less than 10 percent less employees than when you only sell five dollars . Why ?
Because it 's 50 50 , the choice of choice , so it 's so hard to decide what you choose to choose to make it out .
And then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course .
Now do n't understand that this is not just because people have to eat food food , if you do n't get enough money , because you do n't have enough money to @@UNKNOWN@@ , it means also to make
It 's not going to give you an @@UNKNOWN@@ , not to 5,000 5,000 dollars a year from the @@UNKNOWN@@ who was happy to be able to measure your record .
@@UNKNOWN@@ is a consequence of many choices .
And I think it makes the world looks like this .
They want to make the decision right now , if it 's all for me , right ?
They do n't want to get the wrong investment , or even the wrong thing .
So this is the effect effect . The other effect is that even if we 're going to overcome the process , and we make a decision that we end up with less than the result of choice as if
And there are several reasons for this .
One of them is the way of making a lot of different ways that if you buy a buy , and it 's not perfect -- and it 's perfectly perfect ? It 's just to imagine that you can
The more opportunities there are , the more easy to make it is n't even worse than the choice you meet .
Second , what economists call economists economists .
Dan Dan has made a big point in India by saying how much the way we 're doing is what we 're doing is what we compare .
Well , if there 's a lot of others to think about it , it 's easy to find the properties of the evidence that you make , which makes you feel less with the choice that you choose .
Here 's an example . For those of you who are not New York , I 'm sorry .
But here 's what you should think .
Here 's a couple of people .
Very expensive .
@@UNKNOWN@@ beach . It took all of them .
What could be better ? "
Everyone in my @@UNKNOWN@@ neighborhood is gone .
I could go directly from my house . "
And he spent two weeks after the idea that he 's missing the possibility of a day , a lot of a lot of the space .
We can increase the happiness that we get through our choice , even if we 've got fantastic .
And the more ways of choice have more , the more of the characteristics of these choices are being born into the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Here 's another example .
Now , this cartoon makes a little bit .
He 's going to say a statement about this today , and maybe things to do things .
But a more important thing that he does is , and who you choose to decide what you choose to choose other things .
And these other things like a lot of their own properties , and they 're going to do what they 're doing less .
Third , @@UNKNOWN@@ of expectations .
This has met me when I wanted to make my friends .
I 'm wearing @@UNKNOWN@@ , almost the whole thing .
And there was a time in the front of them in a way , and you bought them , and you have bad @@UNKNOWN@@ , you were incredibly @@UNKNOWN@@ , and if you had long enough , and often enough
So , to buy new trucks to buy a lot of years ago , @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I said , " I 'd like to give you a couple of me , here 's my size . "
And the number of people said , " Do you want to go down , easy , or @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
Do you want to get rid of it , stone ? "
Do you want to @@UNKNOWN@@ with me ?
You 'd like to leave down , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , etc , " and so forth .
My body was down , and after I came back , I said , " I 'd like to be the way that the only thing was the only way . "
He had no idea what this was , so I spent an hour with all these @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and @@UNKNOWN@@ the store -- and I say the truth -- with the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ that I ever had .
I had it better . All of those choice gave me better .
But I felt bad .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to try to explain it .
The reason for me was that I felt worse , and all of these opportunities opportunities , my expectations , which are good for a good pair of friends , go up .
I had very low expectations . I did n't have any kind of expectations , as they were just in one way .
When you were in 100 species , he would have to be perfect .
And what I got was good , but it was n't perfect .
And so I would have what I 've been able to do what I 've been thinking , and what I had was @@UNKNOWN@@ in terms of what I expected .
The amount of opportunities in life is most likely to increase the expectations of the people who think about how good these opportunities are .
And this leads to less happiness with the results , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of the science knows this . Because if you do it , you all know what it is .
The truth is more like this .
The reason is that the only thing was better than everything was worse than it was bad , it was possible for the people to experience experiences that were a strange surprise .
Today , in the world we live in the world -- we 're rich , rich citizens , with respect as an idea -- the best for you can ever hope that things are so good as you expect them
They 're never going to be surprised , because your expectations , my expectations , are high .
The secret to the @@UNKNOWN@@ -- which is what you all came up -- the secret to the low level are low expectations .
I want to say -- a short @@UNKNOWN@@ moment -- I 'm married with a woman , and she 's really wonderful .
I could n't have done better . I did n't have @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But it 's not a bad thing .
And finally , a result of the @@UNKNOWN@@ of bad bad if there 's only one way to buy it , if you 're @@UNKNOWN@@ , and you ask , why is that the answer is clear . The world
If there are hundreds of different kinds of hospitals available , and you buy one of them , and you ask why , who is responsible ?
It 's also clear that the answer is the question .
They could do better .
With 100 different ways of @@UNKNOWN@@ in the @@UNKNOWN@@ , there 's no sorry for error .
And so , when people make decisions , and even if the result of the decisions are good , you feel about it , you 're going to @@UNKNOWN@@ themselves .
@@UNKNOWN@@ depression from the industrial world in the last generation .
And I do n't think a lot -- not the only one , but a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of this explosion of depression , and also , you know , people have the experience that they are so high , because
And this is the @@UNKNOWN@@ that it seems to be more popular , and we feel worse .
So let me remember .
This is the United States , which we 're all right now is completely wrong . It 's not true .
There 's no question , which makes a choice better than no , but it does n't follow , which is more choice than a choice .
There 's a magic amount . I do n't know what it is .
I 'm pretty sure that we 've got this point on the choice of our choice .
Now , as a political question -- I 'm almost done -- when a political question is to think about the thing . That 's what all of these choices are made in the oldest societies , which is the
There are lots of places in the world , and we have heard of many of them , the problem is not the very big choice .
Your problem is that you have too little .
So the things I 'm talking about is a complicated problem of modern , rich societies .
And what 's so smart and @@UNKNOWN@@ is Steve Steve told you yesterday about how much more expensive and hard to drive car car is n't help . It 's a waste of money .
What I 'm telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it 's not easy to do it .
They even hurt .
They worry about that .
If something of what the people do we do is to make decisions decisions to the societies in people with some other choice , it would n't just be able to save the lives of our lives , but our
@@UNKNOWN@@ call this a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ is going to worry that it 's all better -- it 's not just the poor -- because all of these great choice are coming .
And finally , you can read this cartoon , and a little person , says , " Ah ! What does this fish ? "
You do n't know anything in this case . "
@@UNKNOWN@@ imagination , a @@UNKNOWN@@ view of the world -- and that 's the way I read it first .
The more I thought about it , the more I came to the idea that fish fish .
Because the truth is that if you do that , it 's so that you can have no freedom .
If you break it down , so that everything is possible to increase the happiness .
They increase the rise and lower .
Everyone needs a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This is almost with 60 security -- probably also for the fish , definitely for us .
But the @@UNKNOWN@@ of a @@UNKNOWN@@ is a recipe for @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I believe , disaster .
Thank you very much .
You know , I 've talked about some of these projects before we talked about the human genome and what that means , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
In fact , we start from a new point : We 've got biology biology , and we 're going to try to create the digital code in a new phase of biology .
We 've always tried to ask questions .
What is life ? It 's something that I believe that a lot of biologists have tried to understand and see the different levels .
We have different kinds of trying to make it up to the components of components .
We have almost 20 years ago , as we 've been able to have the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , the change of the digital world of biology to the digital world .
Now , what are we going to try to ask if we can save life , or if we can create new life , from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is the smallest genome of a species that can even be able to fly in the lab , and we tried to do that with a little
We made it about about 100 genes from the 500 or 500 , which are here .
But if we look at this laser map , which is very simple , in the comparison of our trust .
So we decided that it 's only the only way to @@UNKNOWN@@ the gene that actually allows us to use the components of these components , and then some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started with the question , we can make a link ?
Is it the chemistry of these really big molecules that we 've ever done before ?
And if we can do that , what we can do this ?
A copy is just by a piece of chemical chemical material .
Our steps at the scale of life were exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code that has been very slowly , but yet , again , and the last thing we 're going to see at a curve curve .
We started started 15 years ago .
It actually took a few years ago with a @@UNKNOWN@@ before before we did the first experiments .
As it turns out , DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines around the world that little small parts of DNA can make 30 , 50 to 50 letters , but it 's an @@UNKNOWN@@ process , so the longer you make a little bit
So we had to create a new way of working with these little pieces together and the error .
This was our first trial , starting with the digital information , the X - ray X .
It 's a little virus of the bacteria .
We created little pieces , made a @@UNKNOWN@@ and had a DNA molecule of about 1,000 letters .
The exciting time we took this piece of @@UNKNOWN@@ , and we found a little bacteria , and the bacteria started the genetic code and read the particles .
The particles particles were coming from the cells , and they came back , and they might be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But recently , I talked to the oil industry , and they said they were doing this model .
They laugh more than her .
So we think that this is a situation in the software that can actually build our own hardware in a biological system .
But we also wanted to go a lot further . We wanted to create a whole @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ , and it has more than the letters of the genetic code , so we thought we could build it in
Design is the key , and if you start with digital information in the computer , we need to have this digital information .
When we first saw the genome in the 1970s , we 've been @@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ in a mistake of 10,000 times .
We found in @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , if we used the original sequence , it would never be possible .
A part of the design is to make pieces of the two letters together , and with the other parts of pieces , have to be able to make smaller smaller parts of these buildings together .
We have unique elements here .
You may have heard that we have @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Think about this : We have a @@UNKNOWN@@ code : A , C , C and T .
@@UNKNOWN@@ of these letters -- these letters are about 20 @@UNKNOWN@@ , and here 's a single sign for each of these @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So we can use the genetic code to write our words with words .
At first , we just got paid .
Some people were fighting that it was n't poetry .
We 've created the pieces together that we could just put them up with @@UNKNOWN@@ , and there are @@UNKNOWN@@ that they 're going to fix and again .
And we started using pieces of pieces , starting with the @@UNKNOWN@@ to @@UNKNOWN@@ letters to put these together to make these pieces together to make it back again , to @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In every step , we 've created these pieces of @@UNKNOWN@@ that we could do it , because we tried to create a very complicated process to create what you 're going to see in a minute .
We 've tried to go to the point .
So , this looks like a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
If we 're going to get this right big thing -- with over 100,000 neurons -- then , that 's not just going to be able to fly up in @@UNKNOWN@@ . It 's all different ways of modern molecular
We knew about a mechanism that 's called @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is going to be able to fix DNA DNA that can make these pieces together .
Here 's an example of this . There 's an organism called @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of the three million wheel .
You can see in the upper field that it 's just going to be apart .
12 to 24 hours later , all the same way as it was .
We have thousands of organisms that can do .
These organisms can be completely @@UNKNOWN@@ , they can actually live in a vacuum .
I 'm absolutely sure that life can happen in space , and it can move on the search for certain conditions .
In fact , the NASA showed that there are lots of things out there .
So here 's a @@UNKNOWN@@ of the molecule that we 've done by using these processes -- we actually use it -- it 's just using @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ using the right design of the pieces that we 've got to
This is not a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's such a big molecule that we can see it in the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
These are images about a half of six seconds .
That 's the phrase that we 've done recently recently .
These are about @@UNKNOWN@@ letters on the code . It 's the largest molecule of the structure that has ever been made by people .
It has a @@UNKNOWN@@ of 300 million .
If we could do it with a @@UNKNOWN@@ of 10 and without @@UNKNOWN@@ , and it would be @@UNKNOWN@@ pages , just by the genetic code .
Now , how do we start using a copy ? How do we turn it ?
Obviously , it 's a very simple thing . It 's much complicated with bacteria .
It 's also easier than you 're in @@UNKNOWN@@ like we 're doing it , and you just take the pump out , and there 's another person , and that 's exactly what you all have heard about the
In @@UNKNOWN@@ , the gene in the cell , but only recently , we have shown that you 're going to be able to create a full - of - a - a - a - a - a -
We called the @@UNKNOWN@@ of a @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I said , are these two different way from humans and mice , and we gave some more genes that we could choose to make this protein . We @@UNKNOWN@@ it
This was a new name in the cell .
In fact , we thought that this is the end , but we tried to do this process .
This is the @@UNKNOWN@@ of evolution .
We 're all species from a species here that has a second one of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , or a third of @@UNKNOWN@@ , every time of thousands of thousands of times in a second .
So people think about evolution as a gene that has happened to be a lot of biology .
There are @@UNKNOWN@@ that are called the DNA DNA .
The one that was in the cell was not there ; we have n't put the genes .
It was discovered in the cell , and realized the other hand as a material material , and so we had only one cell with a new cell .
It @@UNKNOWN@@ blue because of the genes that we had .
And after a very short time , it has all of the characteristics of the species of the species , and a whole new species based on a new species on the new software that we have in the cell
All of these proteins changed the rise of this -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we have .
It may like @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , but we can change by the software DNA , things quite dramatic .
Now I did n't think that this is not the @@UNKNOWN@@ -- this is based on a billion billion years .
And I 've been thinking that we 're going to create a new form of the atmosphere that has been going to create a lot of new technologies based on this digital design .
Why should we do that ?
I think it 's pretty obvious at what we need .
We 're about six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
To make it in my context , I was born in the year .
Today , there are three people on this planet for every year in the year , and there 's five years ago .
We have problems with food , with incredible and clean water , medicine , fuel for four billion people .
It will be a challenge for nine .
We need about five billion dollars of coal , @@UNKNOWN@@ billion oil oil , which are hundreds of millions of @@UNKNOWN@@ on the day .
If we think about biological processes , or any of the process , which is going to replace it , it 's a huge challenge .
Then , of course , there 's all the CO2 from this material in the atmosphere .
We have now , from our discoveries from the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and I want to believe that these are the future of the future .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ had a few different components , and look at the diversity of this .
We 're here in the line line across the limits of the biological reality and the idea of our idea .
We 've got technologies today from this quick @@UNKNOWN@@ to do what we call @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We now have the ability to build a big robot to build the millions of genes on the day .
If you can imagine these 20 million different genes , or these processes , they can go through @@UNKNOWN@@ , or drugs , we can do it with a little small team of learning as the last 20 years .
And it 's just natural selection . We can go to @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , production of chemicals or @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and so forth .
This is a photograph of design design software that we 're working with , which is actually @@UNKNOWN@@ and new species on the computer .
You know , we do n't necessarily know what it looks like . We know exactly how the genetic code will look .
We focus on the fourth generation generation .
They 've been known to corn corn , which is just a bad experiment .
We 've got the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the third generation generation , and third generation will be going to be very much more likely to be @@UNKNOWN@@ , like @@UNKNOWN@@ or different ways of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But , as we think , the only way to understand biology is a big impact with any other amount of the cost of food or the @@UNKNOWN@@ of its own , when we see CO2 as well , and
And we think that we 're going to be the first generation of the fourth generation of our generation generation , and this is about 18 months .
@@UNKNOWN@@ and CO2 is a way .
But -- in our discovery of the world , we have all kinds of different ways .
This is an organism that we 've discovered in .
He lives in the deep deep , about a @@UNKNOWN@@ of miles deep , almost almost @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It turns out in methane , by the use of hydrogen as energy .
We 're trying to see if we can collect CO2 CO2 , which can just be able to be able to make carbon CO2 , which is the CO2 in the fuel to use this process .
Within a short period of time we think we could be able to get one of the basic questions of life .
You know , we really have -- @@UNKNOWN@@ targets like the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the whole industry industry . Right ? If you do n't want to be able to TED at TED .
But the same thing we 're working right now is to do the same approach for development development .
They 've seen this year with the flu , and we 're still a year back , and we have a dollar to do it when it 's right to do the right vaccine .
I think that this is going to happen by changing @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That 's how the future might be going to be able to change in the world today , which is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
We 're from light light away from our lives . We 're also able to have a chance to have a chance to be able to survive that much .
On the last TED conference , I had an idea for the LHC .
And I went back to come to explain how the machine works .
So it 's so far . And for all of those who were not at the time , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment that we 've ever done -- 27 miles in the diameter .
His task is to create the conditions that less less than one second after the universe of the universe -- and this to 600 million times in a second .
It 's just just @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This is the machine under @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We take pictures of these @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in these .
This is what I 'm working with . It 's called @@UNKNOWN@@ -- 20 meters in the diameter , 20 meters in diameter .
Here 's a remarkable picture of the @@UNKNOWN@@ in the design that you can see .
On 10 , last year , the machine started the first time .
And this picture was taken by @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It took a huge amount of control control .
It 's a picture of the first @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ the whole line around the LHC , then at the end of the LHC @@UNKNOWN@@ to find a rain of particles on the ground .
In other words , when we saw this image on 10 , we knew that the machine works , which is a great @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I do n't know if this is the largest @@UNKNOWN@@ , or this , when someone looked at the Google and the front page .
It means that we have a cultural impact between the scientific government .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine that I had to do with these lines here -- that we 're using these @@UNKNOWN@@ .
These kinds of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ the machine on the machine .
Now , the engineers are going to look at them and say , " No , do n't do it . These are little @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
You can afford that , because if you 're going to go very far down , you 're going to call it a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So , at @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , when the room between the stars , these neurons can be able to move these neurons .
In one of the connections between between @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in the LHC , there was a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So , instead of using the @@UNKNOWN@@ of light and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , suddenly suddenly @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This was the result .
Now , that 's all the time when you imagine that the @@UNKNOWN@@ are about 20 tons and a half inches away .
So it 's about 50 of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And they needed to do what we did .
We @@UNKNOWN@@ them , @@UNKNOWN@@ them .
They 're now coming back to their own .
At the end of March , the LHC will be back .
We 're going to put it on , and we 're first first data in June or June , and we 'll take our journey to see what the buildings of the universe are .
Well , of course , on a way , again , again , again , again , the process of thinking about the value of science and engineering things , and it 's easy to do something .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact that we do beyond our borders , the value of things like the LHC .
I 'm going to give my last words of a English scientist . @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , who I think , as he said , is the most exciting experiments of his @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , his @@UNKNOWN@@ was Michael @@UNKNOWN@@ ,
Thank you very much .
I 'm a writer .
@@UNKNOWN@@ write my job , but it 's more than that .
It 's also my big , life and love .
And I do n't expect it to change .
But it 's a little bit of something weird in my life and my career , which has led me to my life at this work .
This is an event event that I wrote a book written -- a joke called " @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ -- which is , " other things like all my books books from some reasons in the world and
And the result is that I do n't matter where I 'm going to be treated as if I was going to go back .
@@UNKNOWN@@ seriously .
For example , they 're worried about me and say , " Do n't you do that you 're not going to win that success ?
Do n't you have a fear that you 're going to do your entire life and never back a book , which someone else in the world ?
Okay , that makes really courage .
It would be worse than if I did n't remember that I was thinking about 20 years ago when I was as a teenager , when I first told them that I wanted to be the same way that I
The people said , " Do n't you have no fear to have succeeded ?
Did n't you have a fear that you 're going to do with the @@UNKNOWN@@ of a @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
Did n't you have a fear that you do that in your life on your life , and you never get something back , and you 're going to die on a @@UNKNOWN@@ of dreams , you 're going to
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions : " Yes . "
Yeah , I 'm afraid of all of these things .
And I had always .
And I 've got more much more things that we do n't want any of them .
How like -- and other things .
But when I think about the time I 've been thinking about it , and I wonder why ?
Is that rational ?
Is it going to make sure that someone would be supposed to be afraid that he 's afraid to do the work that he feels ?
And what 's true with the creative version of the world , that they make us feel about the health condition -- in a way , how do they do other jobs ?
My dad , for example , was a lawyer , and I ca n't even have a moment in his 40 years as a leader that he was asked if he should be afraid .
Right ? You can , John @@UNKNOWN@@ , how do you do it ?
It did n't just know you know ?
But to be fair to -- the group of the world have written over the centuries of the centuries that we do n't call the @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But I think that we seem to have this kind of reputation , but not only the author , but the @@UNKNOWN@@ of all of the future , they have to call this reputation , @@UNKNOWN@@ , is going to
Everything that you have to do is , the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of really great stories in the 20th century , the young and often of their own patients .
And even the people who do n't actually self - @@UNKNOWN@@ , and they found themselves in their own @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Norman @@UNKNOWN@@ said about a death in his last interview : " Every of my books has a little bit later . "
It 's an extraordinary statement that you can do about your @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But we do n't even when we hear someone like this , because we have this kind of @@UNKNOWN@@ that long as long as long time , and we 've got the idea so that we can feel that creativity
The question I want to ask today is this idea for you all right ?
Do you feel like that ? Because with only one inches away from the surface -- I do n't feel with this idea at all .
I think it @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And I think it dangerous . And I do n't want to watch the next century .
I think it 's better if we live our big @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And I 'm definitely sure that it 's for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous to start looking at this dark way of the idea of @@UNKNOWN@@ -- especially in the fact that I 'm in my career
This is -- you see , I 'm pretty young . I 'm only about 40 years old .
I may have another 40 @@UNKNOWN@@ in me .
And it 's extremely likely that everything I 'm going to write about in the world as the work that 's going to be back after the @@UNKNOWN@@ of my last book , right ?
I say it 's because we 're here today , and I 'm all kind of friends -- it 's very likely to be that my greatest success is behind me .
Oh , Jesus , what a thought !
These are the kind of thinking that someone can give you to nine nine morning in the morning , to drink , and I do n't want to .
I would never continue to do this work that I love .
So the question : How ?
After some of the time , I seems to remember that I can continue to write a way of @@UNKNOWN@@ psychological structures .
Now , somehow , I have to find a way of thinking about writing a certain distance between myself , and my very natural natural way of thinking about what 's going to be wrong .
While I look at the last year , I started looking at models to do that I 've been looking at the past , and I tried to find other societies to see if they might be better or more
And I looked at the old Arab and the old flu .
Please follow me , because the circle will go back .
But in the Arab Arab and Rome , people did n't believe that creativity of people are okay , okay ?
They believed that creativity was a way of the spirit mind that was out of a distance , the source source to the people -- from @@UNKNOWN@@ , new reasons .
The Greeks called this @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of creativity .
From @@UNKNOWN@@ , he heard that he believed that he would have a @@UNKNOWN@@ that he could @@UNKNOWN@@ out of others .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ had the same idea , called this kind of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ spirit .
That 's great . It did n't really think that a genius was a very clever person .
They thought that a genius of these kind of magic creatures was out of the world that it could literally live in the walls of a @@UNKNOWN@@ of life -- about like @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ -- the @@UNKNOWN@@ and
This is brilliant -- because it 's the distance that I talked about -- the psychological psychological that you want to get away from the consequences of work .
And everybody knew that it worked so hard ?
The artists of @@UNKNOWN@@ was a certain certain way , for example , too much , right ?
If your job was great , you do n't have to hear everything about it , and everybody knew that you have this genius genius , which has helped .
If your work does n't work ? "
Everybody knew what was genius .
So the people in the West were really long thinking about creativity .
And then the genius and everything changed . We had this big idea . And this big idea was : Let 's imagine the human individual in the center of the universe -- about all of the gods , and
It 's the beginning of the leader , and the people started to think that creativity was completely from the individual individual .
For the first time in history , you hear people or these artists have a genius -- instead of that he has a genius .
I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
Do you know ? I think it 's a little person to imagine that he thinks , and it 's like the @@UNKNOWN@@ , like the @@UNKNOWN@@ and the essence and the source of all the creative , creative ,
It 's like someone to ask the sun .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ and the whole whole , and it makes all of these @@UNKNOWN@@ expectations of success .
I think that this success -- that our artists have the last 500 years .
And if that 's true -- and I think it 's true -- is the question .
Can we change it ?
Maybe maybe a way to understand about the relationship between people and the puzzles of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Maybe not .
Maybe we can make the @@UNKNOWN@@ from 500 years ago , not just in a @@UNKNOWN@@ talk .
And there are certainly people in this audience , which really really should be @@UNKNOWN@@ scientific theory about the idea of -- basically , the people and @@UNKNOWN@@ on their projects .
I 'm not going to take all of you on this journey .
But the question I want to do is , why not ?
Why not that ?
Because it does n't matter how much other things I 've heard about when I was talking about the whole crazy @@UNKNOWN@@ of the creative process .
A process that -- as everybody knows that it 's ever trying to make something -- -- in other words , all of this -- not always @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In fact , it might sometimes be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I 've had a similar experience when I met the oldest American American @@UNKNOWN@@ , who 's now about 90 , but the entire entire life was @@UNKNOWN@@ , and she told me that she was when she was in
She said it would like a train train .
That 's the country on her country .
She felt when it came up , because it would make the ground under its feet to @@UNKNOWN@@ .
She knew that she was able to do that moment just one thing . And that was -- in her words -- " @@UNKNOWN@@ like the hell . "
They ran out of the hell to the house , and she was written by this poem , and it was just going to be able to get it enough enough to get a piece of paper and a pencil
In other words , she did n't go fast enough , and they ran down , and they ran down , but they did n't put the house , and the poem was going to walk through them , and
And then there were these moments -- the part I never forget -- she said that there were moments of them that they were almost missing .
So , she goes up to the house , and he 's looking for the paper and the poem , and she 's going to make a pencil just like it , and she said -- it was like it
She played the poem at his tail , and she went back into her body , and it took it on the sheet of paper .
In this possibility , the poem came up and @@UNKNOWN@@ on the piece of paper -- but backwards -- the last word for the first .
When I heard that , I thought , " This is extremely -- that 's exactly what my creative process is going . "
That 's not what my creative process -- I 'm not the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I 'm a @@UNKNOWN@@ . I can work to work with every day at the same time , and I feel @@UNKNOWN@@ and really uncomfortable .
But even in my @@UNKNOWN@@ , I sometimes had this thing .
And I guess that many of you did that .
Even I had work , or ideas that come from a source by myself , which I do n't really recognize .
What 's the thing ?
And how do we do it with no relationship with our mind , but not in the opposite even to health health ?
For me , it 's the best living example of how you can do that , and this can be able to meet the leader , and I gave him a few years ago for a magazine .
We talked about this issue . And you know what ? The most of his life was Tom @@UNKNOWN@@ of the modern @@UNKNOWN@@ , who was trying to make these @@UNKNOWN@@ creative , the @@UNKNOWN@@ in him , and you
But then he was older and down . He told me that he was one day on a @@UNKNOWN@@ in Los Angeles , and it changed everything for him .
He went up with high speed when he suddenly a little bit of a curve , which is the way it seems to be @@UNKNOWN@@ , because it 's hard enough to go , and he wants it . You
He did n't have a piece of paper he did n't have a pencil , he did n't have a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So he starts to get this old @@UNKNOWN@@ in him , like , " I 'm going to do this thing , and I 'm going to hear about this song on forever .
I 'm not good enough , I ca n't do it . "
But instead of curiosity , he just stopped .
He ended up all the way and doing something completely new .
He just looked at the sky and said , " Sorry , you ca n't see that I drive the car ? "
" What I could do as I could just write a song ?
If you really have to go , go back to a moment moment when I take care of you .
If not , @@UNKNOWN@@ today .
Go and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
His whole story has changed .
Not the work itself . It was still like dark and ever .
But the process , and the hard thing that he was looking at him was free when he got the genius out of it , where he did n't get something in trouble , and he was going to go
It could be a @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , weird collaboration , a kind of conversation between Tom and the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the thing that was not very Tom .
When I heard this story , it changed a little bit of the way I worked and I 've saved it .
So this idea , when I was in the middle of @@UNKNOWN@@ , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
Not just bad , but the worst of all times .
I started thinking , I should do this project .
But then I remember it was like Tom in the @@UNKNOWN@@ sky and I tried it .
So I took my view from the fascinating and talk about the comment in a corner corner of the room .
I talked to say , " Stop , you know , and I do both of them , when this book is not brilliant , is that it 's not completely my fault , right ?
Because you see I 've got everything I 've done , I do n't have more than that .
So if you have to do better , you have to go up here , and you 've got rid of the content .
Okay . But if you do n't do -- you know what the hell is going to do .
I 'm going to write about it , because that 's my job .
And I want to give you what I 'm going to do today for my part of the jobs here . "
Because ... -- at the end , it 's like this .
These were always great , because the @@UNKNOWN@@ were professional and they were fantastic .
But again and again , very rare , something special happened . One of the actors was actually @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And I know that you know what I mean , because I know that you all have in your life once once seen that .
It was when it took the time and @@UNKNOWN@@ the book through a kind of @@UNKNOWN@@ , and he did n't do anything else than he ever had done before -- 1,000 days before , but everything was together .
And suddenly , it did n't even more longer than human .
He was getting out of the inside , and down down , and all of it turned through a fire fire .
When something happened when he knew what people did .
They made the hands together , and started dancing , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , God , God , God . "
That 's God , you know ?
And what 's interesting about this time , when the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , they brought this practice with the same way that happened in the history of the centuries of " @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@
If there was a leader in Spain , something I did n't say , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , great , @@UNKNOWN@@ , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , because it 's a look at God .
And that 's great , because we need it .
But the most part of the next morning , when the irony itself , and he says that there was 11 o'clock in a @@UNKNOWN@@ -- and he never does n't ever a @@UNKNOWN@@ of God in his own .
He 's just a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ with @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and maybe it will never be back to those @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And maybe again , someone does n't name someone 's name , if it turns out , but what do he start with the rest of his life ?
That 's hard .
This is one of the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of a creative life .
But maybe it does n't have to be full of full of time when you did n't believe in the beginning of all of the things that you have .
If you may just believe that they 're a @@UNKNOWN@@ -- from one source of a source source for a @@UNKNOWN@@ of your life , which someone else else is when you 're finished .
If we start thinking about it , it changes everything .
That 's how I started thinking , and so I think with security in the last months , while I was working on the book , which is going to be soon -- when the dangerous thing , I think
What I have to say , even if I 'm crazy , I 'm not afraid .
Be not .
Just just do your job .
Just continue to keep up with what 's going to be in his life .
If your job is dancing .
If you do that , the genius of the genius that you 're trying to do is to choose to make a short moment of wonder about your effort , " @@UNKNOWN@@ ! "
And when it does n't dance up with his dance .
And " @@UNKNOWN@@ ! "
I believe I think I should feel that .
" @@UNKNOWN@@ ! "
Thank you .
Thank you .
@@UNKNOWN@@ !
Last year , I 've shown these two slides slides , to prove that the ocean @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is almost four million years ago , the size of the age of income , had 40 percent .
But this is not just enough enough to deal with this particular problem , because it 's not the @@UNKNOWN@@ of ice ice .
In a certain sense , the ocean @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ the heart of our global @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It grows in the winter and winter in the summer .
The next slide I 'm going to show you is a @@UNKNOWN@@ in the last 25 years .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ is red .
As you see , it grows on the @@UNKNOWN@@ of this . This is the last ice in the winter , and it 's in the summer .
This is called @@UNKNOWN@@ , five years old or older , which is almost like blood , which comes from the body here .
In 25 years , it 's going to be here .
This is a problem , because the warming is the frozen reason to see the ice ocean , in the vast amount of carbon in carbon carbon , which , when he @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of microbes .
In fact , with the whole amount of @@UNKNOWN@@ in the atmosphere , it would take this amount of oil when we 're going to put this critical point .
Now , today , in some of the ice , we 're going to go from methane from the water .
A @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of the University in Alaska is a group of a group of a group of @@UNKNOWN@@ in the other Sea of the last winter .
Wow !
You 're fine . The question is , how will it be ?
And one reason is that this enormous amount of climate is coming from the north .
This is a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But the amount of higher greater than ever before .
This is the @@UNKNOWN@@ river .
If you want to know how the sea level rise down , you 're going to get into the sea .
These rivers are moving forward .
On the other end of the planet , the Antarctica , the largest planet on the planet .
Last month , the whole continent has a negative @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And the @@UNKNOWN@@ , which has been a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is special in the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This is 20 20 feet like this .
In the Himalayas , the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , you see the new @@UNKNOWN@@ , which were a few years ago .
40 percent of all people on the world are half half their @@UNKNOWN@@ from this @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In the @@UNKNOWN@@ , this is the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the city for the city .
The water have increased .
But when she @@UNKNOWN@@ , it 's also the most water water .
In California , there was 40 40 percent of the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the Sierra @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This is the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And the predictions they read , they 're serious .
These @@UNKNOWN@@ in the whole world leads to a dramatic rise in terms .
And the disaster everywhere all over the world have been in a really @@UNKNOWN@@ , and never never done before .
@@UNKNOWN@@ so many in the last 30 years , in the last 30 years .
This is a completely @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
If you look at this historical story , you can see what it is .
In the last five years , we have 70 million tons of tons of CO2 , which is almost 24 hours -- 25 million tons of every day in the oceans .
Look at the area of the Pacific , right across the continent of the continent continent , and the Indian @@UNKNOWN@@ , where there is a decline in the ocean in the ocean .
The largest factor of the global warming , which is , 20 percent , is the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the largest largest problem .
The United States are one of the two decades of @@UNKNOWN@@ , with China .
And the prediction was to make lots of other @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But we start to change a change .
Here are the ones that have been published in the last few years , with some green markets that have been @@UNKNOWN@@ .
There 's a political argument in our country .
And the @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ have spent a dollar - dollar dollars of @@UNKNOWN@@ to sell nuclear coal , which is what happens to us .
This picture came to something .
In order to go back to me at home at home , a billion tons of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They saw it in the news .
This is in our whole country of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ America .
This happened at night .
One of the @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ was this .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ is a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He gives it into skin and lots of America in America , and it helps our economy to grow .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ every day .
He 's affordable and @@UNKNOWN@@ , and workers go to stay and bread .
This is the source of most coal in West Virginia .
The most powerful thing is the leader of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So let me tell you a photograph . Al Gore , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , Harry @@UNKNOWN@@ , they do n't know what they 're talking about .
So , the @@UNKNOWN@@ for two @@UNKNOWN@@ into the life .
This is a part of her .
In the @@UNKNOWN@@ , we see climate change as a serious threat for our business .
That 's why we put it up to the top of the top , a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ to give a @@UNKNOWN@@ on the way to make the truth about coal .
The fact is coal .
We believe it 's clean -- and it also smell good .
So , do n't worry about the climate change .
@@UNKNOWN@@ it .
@@UNKNOWN@@ of coal , you 've heard a lot of it .
So let 's make a tour of modern modern , clean @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Fantastic ! This machine is pretty loud .
But it 's the sound of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And yet , the coal of coal is one of the most important global global warming , which is remarkable , clean , which they see here .
Look at it , this is the world today .
Finally , the positive alternative to our economic challenge and our challenge of national challenge .
America is in a crisis that economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
The red line that all of us all of us is our skin of carbon @@UNKNOWN@@ , like coal and coal oil .
But now there 's a symbol , new solution to help us from this @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ America with 100 percent solar power , within the next 10 years .
A plan to America back to work to make sure we 're going to do better and to help global global warming .
Finally , a solution that 's big enough to solve our problems .
@@UNKNOWN@@ America .
This is the last one .
It 's about a @@UNKNOWN@@ of America .
One of the best ways of taking our diet from old , dirty @@UNKNOWN@@ , the way we make our world .
The future is here .
New investment to do good jobs for jobs .
@@UNKNOWN@@ America are .
There 's an old African saying , " If you 're going to be fast , you go alone .
If you want to go , go together . "
We need to come up , and fast .
Thank you very much .
So I want to start with you , at the time of your childhood , when you were playing with @@UNKNOWN@@ .
While you realized how to get the hands out and @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and you 're going to look at it , and to understand problems through the understanding and move through the network .
So this is a moment thinking about how we understand a lot of our environment .
Now , as a computer scientist , inspired by the way of our interaction with physical objects -- with my @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and my colleagues , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , I started to wonder , what if we were using
And this question was so hard that we decided to try to explore the answer and developed .
In a short , it 's an interactive computer in the size of a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
You can move with your hand , and you can see each other , they can control their movements and they have a screen and a screen .
And more importantly , they 're physical , so that you can make them like the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the hands and hands .
And the @@UNKNOWN@@ are an example of a new generation of @@UNKNOWN@@ to digital technologies .
And if these tools are going to become physical and a awareness of their movements , they can see each other and the @@UNKNOWN@@ of our @@UNKNOWN@@ with them , then we can start with the discovery of new and
I start with some simple examples .
This one is the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and if I 'm going to move it into a direction direction , the video goes forward .
And this incredible photograph of each other .
So if I put them up to each other , you want to help the interest .
If they 're surrounded with them , they 'll be able to notice that , and they can be nervous .
And they also also feel their movements .
A interesting amount of interactions that we found that was that we could use any visual brains of data , like color colors , how do you do it with it .
In this case , we can three three times as an @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I can use them to color color in the middle of the water where they 're going .
If we can do it , we can make a little bit more .
There are also some nice ways of education in language like language , mathematics or mathematics , where we 're going to give people the possibility of the fast process and the results that you want to see .
Here I am -- this is an example -- that I 'm using a simple @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This is a game with words , which is a kind of combination of @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And basically , you 're going to @@UNKNOWN@@ all of any of the random letters , and you 're trying to create words , they 're going to be able to do this by a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and again , again , and you have a new @@UNKNOWN@@ and new opportunities .
Thank you very much .
These are some children who went to a trip to the MIT Lab Lab . I could move them to try and try a video of them .
They loved it loved .
A interesting thing about this kind of applications is that you do n't have to give people a lot of instructions .
All you have to say , " @@UNKNOWN@@ words " and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's a few people who test it .
This is our @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ at the bottom .
It turns out that he wanted to put it down .
So for him , they were only @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This is an interactive @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We wanted to create a @@UNKNOWN@@ for @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This is @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He can bring new characters in the scene by looking at the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the table that makes this character .
Here he makes the sun .
The sun goes on .
Now he 's going to make a sense in the scene .
The orange @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Good work ! Yeah !
By the way , the other hand , and she can connect them together with each other .
His own story .
Hi !
It 's a story with @@UNKNOWN@@ , and he can decide how they developed .
@@UNKNOWN@@ cat .
The last example , which I 've been doing now is to show it , is a music -- we live live live live that we 've done , and in the @@UNKNOWN@@ as a sound , like @@UNKNOWN@@ ,
Every has four different variations ; you can choose what you want to use .
And you can hear that sound in the sequence that you can see in different patterns .
And you @@UNKNOWN@@ them , by just just a note that you 're going to have a sequence sequence .
There are the effects that you can live live , like , @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
You put it a little bit of a little bit of it , and he would give it back .
And then more important effects of how fast and speed that you 're on the whole sequence .
So let 's see .
We 're starting to start with the @@UNKNOWN@@ in two sequence -- and @@UNKNOWN@@ them into a series , and then a little more of the voice .
Now , I add an @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Now I 'm going to do something more about this .
And now I 'm going to draw the filter with the @@UNKNOWN@@ that I can control the effect .
I can change the whole sequence by changing the speed in the direction or another direction .
And now I 'm going to use the filter with the @@UNKNOWN@@ , for something more .
I can start with the sequence as it becomes .
So , I do n't have to do it in the plan , but it does n't happen , they 're going to go back or down .
And by the way that I can use the whole sequence by using the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Thank you very much .
So , as you can see , I mean , I mean , I mean , I 'm going to make my desire to help new computers -- the computer engine , the way we can make the better way
And today , I had time to show you a part of this new design design and some of the opportunities that we 're working in our lab .
The idea that I 'm going to give you on the way is that we 're going to be on the threshold of this new generation of @@UNKNOWN@@ with digital media , the information in our world .
Thank you very much .
I 'm happy to talk about you all .
When I was 11 years ago , I was going to go from a morning of the sounds of the joy .
My dad heard on his little bit of the radio , the radio of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He looked very happy , which was a very unusual thing , because it was the news of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He called , " The Taliban are gone . "
I did n't know what this meant , but it made my father , very happy .
" Now you can go to a real school , " he said .
This morning I never forget .
A school school .
The Taliban follow the power in Afghanistan when I was six , and she would go to school .
That 's why I 'm five years long ago , and I had my sister sister who could n't even have to go ahead and to get a secret school .
Just as we could go to school .
Every day we took another other , so that nobody would guess where we went .
We 've got our books in @@UNKNOWN@@ , so it looked like it , as we just go out .
We were born in a house , about 100 girls in a small living room .
In the winter , it was @@UNKNOWN@@ , but in the summer , it was incredibly hot .
We all knew that we live our life : teachers , students and our parents .
And again , the course of the course of a sudden , after a week , because the Taliban were @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We were n't sure how much they knew about us .
@@UNKNOWN@@ them ?
Did they know where we live ?
We were afraid , but we wanted to go to school .
I had a lot of happiness in a family growing up in education than education and daughters .
My grandfather was at the time .
It 's a @@UNKNOWN@@ from a remote Republic of Afghanistan . He was on his daughter -- my mother -- to school , and he was sent to his father .
My mother mother became a teacher .
That 's her .
Two years ago , she went into school , only to our house in a school for girls and women from the neighborhood .
And my father -- this was the first person in his family , who ever had an education education .
For him , it was clear that his children had a education education , even his daughters , despite the Taliban , despite all of the risks .
He saw it as a much greater risk of his children not to go to school .
I know exactly what I 'm going to do during the Taliban sometimes so frustrated by our lives , from the fear and the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I had to feel good , and my dad said , " daughter , listen to me . You can lose your life .
Your money can be @@UNKNOWN@@ . You can go to the war on your house .
But there 's a thing that you 're going to keep on , and what 's going on here , and even if we do with our blood for your pay to pay attention , we 're going to do
So -- are you going to give up ? "
Today , I 'm 22 years old .
I grew up in a country that has been done by decades of wars .
Less than six percent of the women of my age have a higher high school as the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and if my family were not so much for my education education , I would have one of these women .
Instead , I 'm here today , as proud @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ college .
When I went to Afghanistan , my grandfather , who was from the family of his family , because he has been @@UNKNOWN@@ , his daughters at school to be one of the first ones who were @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He did n't just @@UNKNOWN@@ with my university , but also , that I was the first woman , and I 'm going to do it with the car through @@UNKNOWN@@ .
My family believe me .
I have great dreams , but my family has greater greater dreams for me .
That 's why I 'm a global @@UNKNOWN@@ for @@UNKNOWN@@ , a global campaign for education .
That 's why I have helped me , to see , the first one and maybe only four - year - old for girls in Afghanistan , in the country in the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ for girls .
It 's wonderful to see how the students at the high school at my school with a great leader of all of their opportunities .
And to see how their parents and fathers for them , when they were my parents for me , and despite all the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's not like @@UNKNOWN@@ . That 's not my actual name , and I ca n't show his face , but I 'm the father of my daughter .
About a month ago , his daughter and he was on the road of @@UNKNOWN@@ in her village , and they 're a death on the road to a few minutes .
And when he came home home , the phone and a voice he told him , if he took his daughter back to school , she would try it again .
And he said , " @@UNKNOWN@@ me now , if you want to do it , but I 'm not going to take the future of my daughter at the play of your old and new ideas . "
What happened in Afghanistan , so I realized something that is in the West often , which is the most of us who have succeeded , which is a father who has the value of his daughter , and you
That does n't mean that our mothers are not important role in our success .
In fact , it often often the people who are thinking , and it became a very future future of their daughters .
In the Taliban , a few hundred days to school -- because it was illegal .
But today , in Afghanistan about three million girls were @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Afghanistan is , from America , so different .
The Americans are aware of how this changes are .
I 'm afraid that the changes are not about 30 years , and with the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the United States .
But when I 'm in Afghanistan , when I look at the high school in my school , and their parents , they 're looking for them , they make them , and I see a really future future and
In Afghanistan , for me , a country of hope and the possibility of opportunities , and I remember that every day , the girl who live .
I mean , they have great dreams .
Thank you very much .
Everything I do is , for a living -- my life -- it was made by seven years of work in Africa as young man .
And I started out of course to see -- I see young young , but it -- I have in south , Kenya , Kenya , @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ to create the projects of collaboration with African countries .
And I 've been working on a quote , and every single project we started on the legs , failed .
I was desperate .
I said , 21 years , thought , we 've got good people and good work in Africa .
Instead , we killed everything we did .
Our first project , which is my first book called " @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , " was one of the people that we wanted to say to the people who wanted to show how food food .
We came up with @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in South Asia , in the Great valley , which is @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and we 're talking about the population population , and @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Of course , the people had absolutely no interest in this , so we paid them for the work , and sometimes they came .
We were amazed that there was something like this in the ice valley .
But instead of asking , why they do n't do anything , but we just say , " Thank you very much , we 're here . "
" Just time in time to save people to save the world . "
Of course , it wonderful wonderful in Africa .
We had these @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We could n't believe it and we said the @@UNKNOWN@@ , " Look , just as agriculture . "
When the @@UNKNOWN@@ came up and red , they came up at about 200 days from the river , and then everything .
We said , " Oh God , the @@UNKNOWN@@ ! "
And they said , " Yes , we do n't have agriculture . "
" Why did n't you tell us that ? " " You never asked . "
I just thought , we were so @@UNKNOWN@@ in Africa , but then I looked at what the Americans were doing what they were doing , which was the French .
We 're at least @@UNKNOWN@@ .
You should notice that -- -- you should see the amount that we have in the African African people .
You should read the book , " @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ " by @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , she 's a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The book was published in 2009 .
We @@UNKNOWN@@ the African continent in the last 50 years .
I 'm not going to tell you what this money has done .
You just read her book .
I read from an African thing we have .
We have a lot of other people , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , and there are only two ways we can deal with people . We 're @@UNKNOWN@@ them or we 're @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Both of the words come from the @@UNKNOWN@@ , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , " " which is " "
But they have two different things .
@@UNKNOWN@@ : I 'm going to keep a different culture as if they were my children . " I love you so much . "
@@UNKNOWN@@ : I 'm going to be a different culture as if they were my @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That 's why white people in Africa , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , " @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I 've been found that when I read the book , " The @@UNKNOWN@@ is @@UNKNOWN@@ " by @@UNKNOWN@@ . He said , especially in the @@UNKNOWN@@ when people do n't want any help , they 're going to go
This should be the first principle of help .
The first principle of aid is respect .
Now this morning , the gentleman who 's going to @@UNKNOWN@@ this conference , a @@UNKNOWN@@ on the ground and asked , " Can you imagine a city that 's not @@UNKNOWN@@ ? "
When I was 27 years old , I decided to focus on people , and he created a system called @@UNKNOWN@@ , which never will ever be done , never someone who is going to be @@UNKNOWN@@ , but you
What you do -- you keep the mouth .
You never need a community with ideas that you 're going to connect with people .
We do n't work from office .
We meet us together . We meet us together .
We do n't have infrastructure .
We end together and find out what the person wants to .
The most important thing is passion .
You can give someone an idea .
If that person does n't like this person , what do you do ?
The passion for the economic growth is the most important thing .
The passion for the city is the most important thing .
We help them find that knowledge , because nobody can be successful .
The person with this idea may not be the knowledge , but it 's available .
Many years ago , I had this idea : Why instead in a community and the people who say to what they do , why do n't we listen to them , but not in @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Let me tell you a secret .
There 's a problem with @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Now , I do n't have any of them , and they 'll never be able to tell them what they 're going to do with their money to what they see .
@@UNKNOWN@@ has this @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The people who do n't know the community that you do n't know , because they never forget .
We 're working with one to do this , and create a social infrastructure that does n't exist .
A new job has created .
This is the family of the company , the family of @@UNKNOWN@@ , who 's going to give you in your house , at your table and at the table , you can help to create your passion in your
I have this in @@UNKNOWN@@ , West , Australia .
I 'm trying to go back to the time and trying to find the @@UNKNOWN@@ , where we say , what do they do to do it ?
And so I started working on the first year through the streets and in the first three days of my first year , and I helped him . He @@UNKNOWN@@ fish in a garage , he was @@UNKNOWN@@ . I
And I helped these five farmers to work together , and these wonderful @@UNKNOWN@@ are not at a factory in @@UNKNOWN@@ for 60 dollars per person , but after Japan for @@UNKNOWN@@ dollars and a half .
In a year , I had 27 projects . The government came to ask me , " How do you do that ?
How do you do that ? " I said , " I do something very , very difficult .
I hold the mouth and listen to them . "
So -- -- so the government says , " Do you do it again . "
We 've done it in 300 communities .
We have 40 companies in the city .
There 's a new generation of companies who go to depression .
Peter @@UNKNOWN@@ , one of the best favorite of history of history , died with six years ago .
Peter @@UNKNOWN@@ was @@UNKNOWN@@ , before he started working with companies , and the printer said , @@UNKNOWN@@ is planning with a collective society and the economy . "
@@UNKNOWN@@ is @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So you build @@UNKNOWN@@ , without any of the things that people can use with their money and their energy .
You have to learn how to get this to you .
You have to give them their privacy and privacy . You have to be great to help them , and they 'll be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In a community of 10,000 people , we get 200 of them .
Can you imagine a community of 400 people with the intelligence and the passion ?
So what do you do most of the morning today ?
@@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ people .
I want to say that politics is the right way .
We 're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- @@UNKNOWN@@ fossil fuels , chemistry -- and suddenly , there are systems that are not sustainable .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ is not sustainable .
It 's not sustainable .
We need to look at how we can use seven billion people in sustainable ways to help , and we can use them with them .
The technologies do n't exist .
Who is that technology for the green revolution ? universities ?
The government ?
It will be entrepreneurs . And they 're doing now .
I read a wonderful story in a magazine magazine .
There was a group of experts who were invited to be the future of New York in the year .
In @@UNKNOWN@@ , they came together , and @@UNKNOWN@@ , which was 100 years ago in New York .
Why ? They looked at the curve , and they said , when the population rate at this rate , they needed six million million people to @@UNKNOWN@@ people , and it would be impossible to do it with the
Because they were running around .
In fact , they see the dirty technology that 's life from New York .
So what happened ? 40 years later , in 1900 , there were in the United States .
The idea , a different technology to find the race , there were tiny little buildings in the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ .
There 's a secret to work with entrepreneurs .
First of all , they have to be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Otherwise , they do n't talk to you .
The next thing you 're going to have to do with you , absolutely @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ services .
Then you have to leave them the absolute truth about the authority .
From the smallest to our biggest company , all have to be able to make three things . That has to be @@UNKNOWN@@ , but the @@UNKNOWN@@ has to be @@UNKNOWN@@ and the @@UNKNOWN@@ need .
So guess what ?
We never never had a single person who can make a little bit , and they can sell the money .
That does n't exist .
This person was born .
We did research research , and we looked at the 100 @@UNKNOWN@@ companies around the world -- Carnegie , @@UNKNOWN@@ , Ford , Ford , the new companies , Google , Google .
There 's only one thing that all the successful companies of the world are in the world , but one of them was not one person .
Now now we teach @@UNKNOWN@@ in @@UNKNOWN@@ , and we start the classroom with the first two pages of Richard @@UNKNOWN@@ , and the task of @@UNKNOWN@@ is it , in the first two pages of Richard @@UNKNOWN@@ , how
I never like , " and 32 times . "
He was not alone when he started .
Nobody did a company alone . Nobody .
So , how can we create a community in which , who have a @@UNKNOWN@@ background , in @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ . They were @@UNKNOWN@@ , which they 're going to do , what someone has to do with this
What can you do ? Can you make it ?
Okay , can you sell it ? Can you pay for money ? "
" Oh , no , I ca n't do it . "
We see communities .
We have groups of volunteers who can help the support of them to help them with the resources and people help us , and we found that the wonder of the intelligence of the population population that the culture and
Thank you .
Five years ago , I 've learned how it may be , and I 'm going to be @@UNKNOWN@@ in the world .
The University State University told me -- a museum for communication -- for engineers -- in engineers .
I was afraid .
The real fear of fear .
But when they started talking , they were told me as well as they turned down to the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and a door to a very new world .
As I felt like I was talking about the students , I was surprised at the thoughts that they had , and I wanted to be able to see that this other thing .
I believe to open this door , we need it .
We need great communication of our scientists and engineers to change the world .
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that our biggest problems , like the energy energy , health and health , and if we do n't know about it , and we do n't understand it , it 's
But these great conversations do n't have done when our scientists and engineers do n't want to invite them in their audience .
So scientists and engineers , please , @@UNKNOWN@@ us .
And I want to show you a few ways of how you can do it , that we can see that the science and the technology that you 're trying to do is sexy .
The first question you have to answer to you is , well ?
Let 's say , why do n't just explain what science is so important for us .
Let 's not just tell you that @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , but it also tells us that their @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ structure in our bone , is because it 's important to be able to understand how to understand and
And if you can tell you what it makes you do ,
@@UNKNOWN@@ are a specific to understanding the idea .
For example , you know , and I think , " Well , why do n't you just say " space and time , " which is much more useful for us ?
We have to think of your thoughts , but not the same thing as the level level .
And Einstein Einstein said , " Do n't do things like that , but not easier . "
You can imagine something about your scientific field without having to make up with it .
A few things are looking at other examples : stories , stories and @@UNKNOWN@@ . So , in this way , you can connect us in your own .
And if you do your work work , then let the @@UNKNOWN@@ away .
Have you ever asked why why " @@UNKNOWN@@ " @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
What happens when someone @@UNKNOWN@@ up with another another , and with these dots , your audience .
Now , a slide like this is not just boring , but it 's also very low in the @@UNKNOWN@@ part of our brain , and we 're fast fast .
This @@UNKNOWN@@ from @@UNKNOWN@@ Brown is a lot more powerful . It shows that the special structure of the @@UNKNOWN@@ is so powerful that it 's even the inspiration for the South design of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The trick here is a single way to use the sentence , which is that the audience , when it even gets the @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ , and also the other way , and how to make a
These are just a few ways to help us to open this door , and this is the science and the science in technology .
And the engineers I have taught me to teach myself with the " @@UNKNOWN@@ " in touch , I want to do anything with a equation .
@@UNKNOWN@@ from the science of your science and your @@UNKNOWN@@ , you 're going to get this through the idea , so the audience , which is important , and that 's the whole thing with the passion that you
So scientists and engineers , if you did this equation , @@UNKNOWN@@ me .
Thank you very much .
Hi . That 's my cell phone .
A cell can change a life and a personal freedom .
With a cell phone , you can imagine a crime in human history .
With a cell phone , you can send a message and a @@UNKNOWN@@ in Egypt .
And with a cell phone , you can play a song , it 's @@UNKNOWN@@ at @@UNKNOWN@@ and famous .
All this is with a cell phone .
I 'm in 1984 and I live in Berlin .
Let 's go back back to this city .
And you can see , hundreds of thousands of people , changes on the streets , and they started .
We 're in the fall , and we ask us all of these people , the @@UNKNOWN@@ and changes , a cell cell in the pocket .
Who in the room have a cell phone ?
Keep it up .
Keep your cell phones , you 'll go up .
Keep it up . A @@UNKNOWN@@ , a @@UNKNOWN@@ , wow .
These are lots of them .
But today , I 'm talking about me and my cell phone and talk about how it changed my life .
And I 'm going to talk about this .
These are @@UNKNOWN@@ lines .
Data .
And why are these information there ?
Because in the summer of 2006 , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ has a policy policy .
So this politics is politics .
And this policy says that every company has a company company in Europe , every year in the entire Europe , a whole range of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Who who wants to do ? Who will give you an email ?
Who will ask one text text ?
And if you use a cell phone , where you are .
All of this information is going to be at least at least six months until two years from your phone or your @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And everywhere in Europe , the people came up and said , " We do n't want to . "
They said , we do n't want to do that .
We want to be able to get back in the digital age , and we do n't want us to send out the data , and we all have to get all this information about us .
There were lawyers , @@UNKNOWN@@ , who were all saying , " We do n't want to . "
And here , like you can see , tens of thousands of people on the streets of Berlin , and they said , " freedom . "
And some of them said that this could be going to be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ was @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And I wonder how it really works .
Can you really get all this information about us ?
Every time I use my cell phone ?
So I asked my first company , who would say , the German answer , the back of the largest company in Germany , and I asked them , please , send me all of the information that you 've
And I asked them , and I asked them again , and I did n't have a right answer , just white @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But I told me , I want to have this information , because it 's my life , that you 're going on .
So I decided to make a case against them , because I wanted to have this information .
But the economists say , no , we 'll not give you this information .
At the end , it would be a comparison with them .
I 'm going to give the back back to what they send me all of me .
Because in the meantime , the @@UNKNOWN@@ decided that the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ in the German is @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So I got this ugly brown brown with a voice .
And on the engine was this .
@@UNKNOWN@@ lines .
First , I saw it , and I said , well , it 's a huge @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But then I realized after a while , that 's my life .
These are six months of my life in this photograph .
So I was a little bit of thinking about what I want to start with ?
Because you can see where I 'm at night when I sleep at night .
But then I said , I want to go with this information about the public .
I want to do it .
Because I want to show people what it means .
So with time online and open data City , I did this .
This is a visual from six months of my life .
You can go and @@UNKNOWN@@ , and you can go back and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
You can take a step that I do .
And you can see what I 'm looking at @@UNKNOWN@@ with the train to @@UNKNOWN@@ , and how many calls I go on .
All of this is possible in this information .
That makes a little fear .
But it 's not just me .
It 's all about us .
First , it 's just like I call my wife and she calls me , and we talk a few times .
And then I call some friends friends and call them each other .
And after a while , you call you and you call them , and we have this huge amount of data .
But you can see how people can communicate with each other times , when they go to bed .
You can see everything .
You see the central characters , who are the leader of the group .
If you have access to this information , you can see what the society does .
If you have access to this information , you can control the society .
This is a mirror for countries like China and the Iran .
This is the perfect design of how to create a society , because you know who who wants to share with you , you have an email -- all that 's possible to get access to this information .
And this information will be at least six months , in Europe to two years .
How do I start at the beginning , we asked us all of these people in the streets of @@UNKNOWN@@ in the island of the cell phones in their pocket .
And the fact that I did n't know who has been done with the demonstration of this , and when the leader knew what the leader would be , then that would never happen .
The case of the Berlin wall , maybe not .
And yet , not the case of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Because today , government policies and companies are so much more information about how they can get over us , online and data .
They want to have the possibility of our lives , and they want to do it all the long time .
But self - and - a - life age is not a contradiction .
But yet , you have to fight for those today .
They have to fight for a day .
So if you go home , you tell your friends , which is a value of the 21st century .
If you go home , you tell your @@UNKNOWN@@ , just because companies and government can have the opportunity to use some information , they do n't have to do it yet .
And if you do n't believe me , you ask your company to send the information that you have on them .
So , in the future , every time you 're going to use your cell , you remember that you 're going to have to have the @@UNKNOWN@@ in the digital age .
Thank you .
I live in South Africa .
This is South India : @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So the city come together , and they 've got the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the name of South India , so he can make it something different , they changed him in South Angeles , as if it 's something that
This is South Los Angeles .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So , like @@UNKNOWN@@ million other Americans , I live in the @@UNKNOWN@@ desert of Los Angeles , the home of the @@UNKNOWN@@ and the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The funny thing is that the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ are more people than killing the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
People die in South Central Los Angeles to @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ in my neighborhood , for example , five times more than what happens when you 're going to be @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is about 15 miles away .
I could n't do that anymore .
And I asked me , how do you feel when if you did n't have access access to the food , if you do any time when you go from the house , the negative impact that you have the
I was able to buy that bought and sell more like @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I see @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ like @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And I realized that this has to stop .
I @@UNKNOWN@@ the problem is the solution .
@@UNKNOWN@@ is the problem and food is the solution .
And also , I did n't feel more about @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , to get an apple , which is not with the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So I took a food forest from my house .
It 's a piece of land that we call @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's 45 feet down .
The thing is that it heard the city .
But you have to do it .
So I think , " Great . I can do what I want , because it 's my responsibility , and I have to keep it in the room . "
And I decided to do it .
So I came up with my group , the green Green , and we started up to my @@UNKNOWN@@ -- and @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , so the whole program .
We 're a kind of @@UNKNOWN@@ group , @@UNKNOWN@@ out of all the galaxies , and all of the city , it 's completely , and everything we 're doing is free .
And the garden is beautiful .
But then she @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The city came to me , and he took me a @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I said that I have to go back to the garden .
And I thought , " Come on , right ?
So , a @@UNKNOWN@@ study of learning about food from a piece of country , which you do n't worry ?
And I thought , " @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Because this time would n't do it .
The Times Times about the wind .
We kept the @@UNKNOWN@@ in the hands .
My @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and she said that they support and help what we do .
So , why do n't they do that ?
So , in the United States , most of the most @@UNKNOWN@@ in the city .
They have @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
These are 20 Central Park .
That 's enough area to @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ million @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Why the hell do n't they do that ?
It 's going to be able to create a plant . We have 1,000 dollars .
With green green in the value of a dollar , you can get rid of vegetables and vegetables in the value of 75 dollars .
It 's my @@UNKNOWN@@ , I say people they do their own food .
His own food is how to use their own money .
Look , I have a legacy in South Africa .
I grew up there . I got my sons there .
And I 'm going to be part of this kind of reality that was made by others , and I @@UNKNOWN@@ my own reality .
Look , I 'm an artist .
@@UNKNOWN@@ is my @@UNKNOWN@@ . I built my art .
Right , like a wonderful artist , the walls of @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I use the garden , the Earth , like a piece of stuff , and the plants and the trees are my @@UNKNOWN@@ for this stuff .
You would be surprised what the Earth would do if you use it as a canvas .
You ca n't imagine how it 's an amazing thing , and how people touch it .
So what happened ?
I 've experienced my way back to an instrument for the education and the transformation of my innovation .
To change the community , you have to change the chemistry of the ground .
We are the soil .
They would be wondering how children are influenced .
@@UNKNOWN@@ is the @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ act , which you can do , especially in the city .
And also , you know .
I remember this time when this mother and her daughter came , and it was about @@UNKNOWN@@ at night . They were in my garden , and I came out , and they looked like that .
I felt really bad , because they were there , and I told them , " You know , you do n't have to do that .
The garden is not without the bottom . "
I 've noticed me when I saw people who were so close and hungry , and that 's what I just had to do that , and people said , " Do you have no fear that people are going
And I said , " The hell , no , I 'm not afraid that she @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's also on the street .
That 's the idea .
I want it to take it , but at the same time I want them to make their health . "
For another time , I put a garden in this @@UNKNOWN@@ in New York .
These are the guys who have helped me to keep the trucks .
It was cool , and they shared their stories about how they changed it , and how they were with her mother and their grandmother , and it was great to see how it changed , even if you just
Green @@UNKNOWN@@ has been like 20 years ago .
At our @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , we were 50 50 people , and we were all volunteers .
When children eat grow , children children eat .
If they eat their fish , they eat their teeth .
But if they do n't have any of them , if they did n't show them how food food and body , they 're blind , and they 're blind , and they 're @@UNKNOWN@@ them .
I see young people who want to work , but they 're in this thing -- I see blue children , which are the right on the road , which is for them , and it 's going to lead
This is what I see as a chance where we can train these children to protect their communities , to create a sustainable life .
And if we do that ?
We could see the next George Washington @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But if we do n't change the chemistry of the world , we never do that .
So this is one of my plans . I want to do that .
I want to take a whole lot of @@UNKNOWN@@ , where people can eat the food in the same bar .
I want to take @@UNKNOWN@@ and take it into healthy healthy .
So , do n't understand me wrong .
I 'm not talking about @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , because it 's not sustainable .
The funny thing to sustainability is that you have to have it .
I 'm going to talk about people work and children from the streets , and they feel the joy of the pride and the honor to be able to be able to find their own food , and if you
So , what I do here is to make this sexy .
I want you to protect all of the ecological , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We need to take the image of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
If you 're not a watch , you do n't have a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
You 're going to @@UNKNOWN@@ with @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And let 's the gun of your choice .
If you 're going to meet with me , you do n't call me when you 're going to be able to sit in your chairs and make a meeting where you want to talk about it .
If you want to meet me , you can come up with your own , in my garden , so we can make some @@UNKNOWN@@ .
peace . Thank you .
Thank you .
One of my @@UNKNOWN@@ in the entire Oxford of the dictionary is " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
Because it sounds like that .
And " @@UNKNOWN@@ " means " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
Even in the 19th century , a better definition of a better definition , " A @@UNKNOWN@@ is someone who is a @@UNKNOWN@@ party , @@UNKNOWN@@ from @@UNKNOWN@@ , or @@UNKNOWN@@ , and its success through the natural force of
I do n't have any idea , " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
Something with words , I think .
But it 's very important to say that words in the center of politics , and all the politicians know that they 're trying to control the language .
For example , for example , the first press of the British @@UNKNOWN@@ , newspapers were not the very @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And this was actually coming back to the courage of a man with a remarkable name of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They put it into the @@UNKNOWN@@ of London and @@UNKNOWN@@ him , but he was smart enough , he was smart enough , @@UNKNOWN@@ , and eventually he had so much support in London , he won .
And just a few years later , we find the first evidence for the sentence " as strong as @@UNKNOWN@@ as many .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , on the English word for real time .
But that 's not true . It goes back to a woman 's press .
But to show you , like words and politics , I 'd like to take you in the United States , at the time when they 've just won the independence .
You see the question about how to ask George Washington , which is @@UNKNOWN@@ .
You did n't know .
How do you call the leader of a nation nation ?
It 's been published in Congress for long long .
And there were all kinds of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I mean , some people wanted to come up with Washington Washington , and others , his name George George , and again , other people , the freedom of the people in the United States of America .
Not so @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Some people wanted to call him King .
They thought that it was like .
They were not @@UNKNOWN@@ , they wanted to make the king for a certain period .
It could work .
But everyone was extremely boring , because this debate was three weeks ago .
I 've read the @@UNKNOWN@@ of a @@UNKNOWN@@ that 's constantly writing , " constantly still the same issue . "
The reason for the time and the @@UNKNOWN@@ was that the @@UNKNOWN@@ against the United States .
The mother did n't want to say that Washington @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
King call it , and he may probably have to come up with ideas .
They wanted to give him the @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This title was " President . "
President . You did n't write the title . He did n't exist before , but it meant that someone had a conference @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That 's something like the @@UNKNOWN@@ of a philosopher .
He did n't have much more than the term " @@UNKNOWN@@ " or " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
Sometimes there was a little @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ , but it was really a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That 's why I did it .
They said , " This is ridiculous , you ca n't call him a president .
This guy has to @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Who is going to take it seriously , when he 's a weird little bit of the President of the United States of America ? "
And also three weeks ago , the United States did n't go .
Instead , instead , the title of the president , " he said , " but they wanted to be absolutely clear that they did n't agree with their @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and the @@UNKNOWN@@ of nations , whether it 's
You can learn about three interesting things .
The first -- and this is the best -- until now , I do n't have any way to find out whether the United States has ever been the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And Obama Obama , Obama Obama , who wrote the title , and she 's just waiting to be the United States .
Second , you can learn that when a government says that something is @@UNKNOWN@@ -- -- again , you 're still @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Third , and that 's really important , that 's the most important thing , is that the title of the president of the United States of America today is not so much like that , or ?
This has to do something more than 5,000 5,000 people who have the world and the largest economy of the world and a @@UNKNOWN@@ and the whole stuff .
In fact , the story of the title was size .
And that 's the United States won .
They got a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And the other idea of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the idea of @@UNKNOWN@@ -- now , then it was so .
But you know how many nations have a president ?
@@UNKNOWN@@ .
Because they all want to sound like the guy with the 5,000 pounds , etc .
So at the end of the United States , and she did n't get lost , because nobody is going to feel that when you say , you 're now the president of the United States of America .
And that 's the most important thing you can take , and I 'm going to leave you .
@@UNKNOWN@@ are trying to use words to change reality , and reality reality , but actually changing the reality , even more words than the words could ever change .
Thank you very much .
So I came up with a @@UNKNOWN@@ with 50 50 to fight against a @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ , Florida .
I @@UNKNOWN@@ my black @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ against a pair of brown @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ a rocket in the direction that I could n't see .
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan .
So for the long before I was going to have a war with the war , but @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ at @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ with @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and children -- @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , who were @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and
But this is the central of self .
And so , I 'm here here , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of God @@UNKNOWN@@ , a @@UNKNOWN@@ and a radically @@UNKNOWN@@ artist , who has the last nine nine years in Afghanistan , and he created .
So , there are lots of great things about what you could do art , but I do n't like to make a painting .
I want to take a day in life of a global @@UNKNOWN@@ who 's going to lead to the way that " @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ " @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ religious and political corruption to use it .
And what else can do we get together ? How do we go to the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and to make a @@UNKNOWN@@ with the idea , " How am I going to do , and I 'm rich . "
And try to use this campaign to use these @@UNKNOWN@@ , the way to spend it .
I want to tell the corruption in Afghanistan on the reason , with a project called " @@UNKNOWN@@ , " which you 're going to be treated as a lawyer , a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ on the streets of @@UNKNOWN@@ and
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan I believe in the Islamic conflict .
The war and the other people , who came with him , have created a new environment for @@UNKNOWN@@ and designers , which you can just open up by using a @@UNKNOWN@@ for soldiers and @@UNKNOWN@@ , in which I
And I 'd like to see how a simple @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ between @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ from what 's going to look at a conversation about this , that the world 's @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in their @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ about "
But for all these things can go to prison , they can be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But I do it because I need because the central of self .
That 's my hand . What is your ?
Thank you .
Hi . My name is @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I 've been working as a model .
For 10 years ago , I said .
I have feeling that I 'm going to see here in the room that I 'm going to move into this room , because I would n't have to take this box .
And fortunately , I still have something to do .
This is the first time that someone someone on the TED stage , you can be happy .
If I have a lot of women , I was just when I came out , I do n't need to say that I read it later on Twitter .
And I also think that I 'm quite sure I 'm pretty lucky , because I can change in very short 10 seconds , which you think of me .
It does n't have any chance .
These red are very uncomfortable , it 's good that I did n't want to do it .
The most difficult thing to do the rock over my head is because you 're going to see me all the time , you do n't do it as long as I think about my head .
All right .
Why did I do that ?
That was embarrassing .
Well , it was n't so easy to this picture .
A image is powerful , but a image is also @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I 'm just thinking about it in six seconds .
And on this image -- I had never had a friend .
I felt very uncomfortable and the photographer who said to me back to my back and my hand in the hair of this guy .
And yet from surgery or the wrong @@UNKNOWN@@ that I 'm going to do about two days for the work , there are only very different ways of changing our vision , and our @@UNKNOWN@@ has -- and it 's
@@UNKNOWN@@ to his name for me today .
And I 'm on the stage , because I 'm a model .
I 'm standing on this stage , because I 'm a beautiful , white woman , and in my business , we call it a sexy girl .
I 'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me , but in the honest way .
The first question is , " How do you get a model ? "
I say , " Oh , I discovered , " but that means nothing .
The real reason I was a model that 's a profit in the genetic investment and an important legacy , and maybe you ask yourself , that this legacy is .
Now , in the last few centuries , we do n't only beauty as well as young as young and young and @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is that we 're inspired by organic , but also as big as @@UNKNOWN@@ ,
This legacy was created for me . And it 's a legacy , which for me .
I know , there are people in the audience who are at this point , and maybe also some @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , " @@UNKNOWN@@ . @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
And first of all of my model model . Very amazing .
But unfortunately , I 'm going to tell you that in the first year , a very @@UNKNOWN@@ student at the top of all of the models at the top of them , and every single one , which was
The next question I 'm always asked is , " Can I make a model , if I grew up ? "
And I said , " I do n't know it 's not in my responsibility . "
But the second answer I want to do this little girl , I mean , " Why ?
You know what ? You can do anything .
You can go to the United States or the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the next Internet or a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is completely wrong , because then you were the first one . "
If they 're going to say this great question , still say , " No , no , @@UNKNOWN@@ , I want to make a model . "
Because I do n't have any responsibility for anything , and you could n't imagine the American @@UNKNOWN@@ of the American @@UNKNOWN@@ or the @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ or the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And to say that you 're going to be a model , which is as if you want to say that you 're going to @@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ in the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
You ca n't change it , and it 's fantastic and it 's not a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Now , I 'd like to give you 10 years of model model , because you can only do it as well .
If there 's a photograph there , and the light is exactly there , like a nice @@UNKNOWN@@ , and the clients says , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , we want to take a photograph in the game , " OK ,
It looks like this .
I do n't feel that weird .
That was -- I do n't know what happened .
If you 're going to school school , and you 've got a letter and a few jobs have , you ca n't even say much more . If you say that you 're going to be the United States
The next question I 'm going to ask is , " Are all the photos ? "
And yeah , all of these photos are @@UNKNOWN@@ , but that 's just a small part of the story .
This is the first photograph I 've done , and that was the first time I was wearing a half - year ago . I did n't even see my time .
I know that 's going to be right now , but I was a young girl .
So I just saw a few months ago with my grandmother .
This is me one day .
My friend had to play me .
That 's me on a @@UNKNOWN@@ party , a few days ago , a @@UNKNOWN@@ for French French .
This is me with the @@UNKNOWN@@ team and in the World magazine .
And that 's me today .
And I hope you can see that these images are not pictures of me .
It 's a story , and it 's a group of groups , by @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ and all their @@UNKNOWN@@ and the @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Okay , so next people ask me , " Do you make things for free ? "
Yeah , I have a lot of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , which I never can do , but just the things that I 'm going to do for me , is things that I 'm talking about in real life and
I grew up in Cambridge and a day , and I went to a store and I had my money , and you gave me a @@UNKNOWN@@ for free .
As a teenager , I went to my friend with a @@UNKNOWN@@ , and she @@UNKNOWN@@ a red light , and , of course , we stopped .
I 've got these free things because of my mind , and not because of my personal and there are people who are not because of their @@UNKNOWN@@ , and not because of their personality have a high price .
I live in New York , and I 've been saved by the high - year , who were in the last year and @@UNKNOWN@@ , 75 percent , and most young men .
It live in New York only @@UNKNOWN@@ , young men , and black men , who do n't ask the question , " Am I going to stop ? "
I mean , " How often am I going to do ? When I 'm going to go ? "
In my research research , I found out that seven percent of all - a - year - old girl in the United States does n't like her body , and that number goes up to 90 percent , when
The last question is , " How is it going to be a model ? "
And I think they 're going to answer this answer : " If you 're a little bit of @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ hair , you feel very happy and beautiful . "
And let 's give you a answer that might give you this idea .
We say , " It 's really great to travel so much , and it 's great , with creative , inspired , to make people love . "
Everything that is true , but it 's only half a story of history , because what we never never before before the camera , I never never seen the camera that I say . "
And I feel like this , because I need to talk about my day .
And if you ask me , " Would I be happy when I had legs legs and @@UNKNOWN@@ hair ? "
And then you have to do a lot of models , because they have the legs legs and the @@UNKNOWN@@ hair , and the @@UNKNOWN@@ of them , and they are the size of their @@UNKNOWN@@ , and they 're
When I did this talk , I found it very hard to get an honest issue , because I felt very uncomfortable with me , and I say , " I 've got all the benefits from a @@UNKNOWN@@ that
It was very , very hard , a legacy of gender , and race , if I am one of the largest largest .
But I 'm also happy and I 'm going to honor to be here , and I think it 's great that I 've got here , and I 'm going to get before , or 10 or 30 years
If you take a little bit of this talk , I hope that we all have the power of the image in our own @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Thank you .
I 've never heard the words of my grandmother , which has been alive in the life of life , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ resistance .
But I never never going to do something like this .
Now , it 's almost two years ago since the revolution revolution has been inspired by the waves of the @@UNKNOWN@@ and both of the @@UNKNOWN@@ as the @@UNKNOWN@@ revolution .
I @@UNKNOWN@@ with a lot of other @@UNKNOWN@@ , within the outside of the day , a day of @@UNKNOWN@@ and about a revolution against the @@UNKNOWN@@ regime .
And there she was a big revolution .
Boy , women women and men were in the first line , who were the end of the regime , the freedom of freedom , dignity and social justice in the air .
They have @@UNKNOWN@@ courage by asking themselves against the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They have a very important sense of faith in the West East across the West West , to the south .
And finally , after a period of six months ago , and we had 50 million people , and we put it to our country and the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
However , there 's a big amount of energy , a legacy of democracy , the corruption and the basis for @@UNKNOWN@@ .
For four decades , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and both the infrastructure , as the culture and the moral structure of the social society .
And the challenges and the challenges that I broke , like so many other women , the civil civil civil society , again , and we 're going to create a @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I 'm going to create a
There 's 200 200 years ago , and immediately after the case of @@UNKNOWN@@ in @@UNKNOWN@@ , almost 300 in @@UNKNOWN@@ .
After 33 years ago , I came back back to @@UNKNOWN@@ , and with @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , I started making the issues of @@UNKNOWN@@ , human development and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
With a wonderful group of women , I started to @@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ of women , a movement of women , leaders from different @@UNKNOWN@@ , their goal , which is for public health for the @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ and
In the @@UNKNOWN@@ , I met a very hard environment , a environment that 's always more powerful . A environment , which is by the politics of politics and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I did a project of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ women , to make a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , a law that every person who does n't care about the background , the right should choose to choose and to do it , and
At the end , we launched our grandmother and successful .
Women won @@UNKNOWN@@ percent of the @@UNKNOWN@@ in the United States .
But even though , the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the election and the global revolution -- -- every day , we 're going to @@UNKNOWN@@ new news from violence .
And one morning , we went to the message about @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In the other morning , we got the message about the Israeli - American @@UNKNOWN@@ and the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And again , again , in the other morning , the @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ the army .
And really , day , we 're suffering from the top of the @@UNKNOWN@@ and their @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ against the human rights , and their rules of rules and rules .
Our society , and by one of the reality , @@UNKNOWN@@ and self - @@UNKNOWN@@ from the moral and principles -- freedom , dignity , social justice -- which she had started to do .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ were the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I 'm not here today to inspire you with the success story of our @@UNKNOWN@@ list .
In fact , I 'm here today to say that we have as a nation , the wrong choice and the wrong decisions .
We put our results wrong .
Because the election did n't win peace and stability in stability .
Is that the list list and the change between women and women , peace and national rights have been organized .
No , she did n't .
What 's it ?
Why does our society continue to continue , and @@UNKNOWN@@ from politics politics and the @@UNKNOWN@@ , both of men as women ?
Perhaps that women were not the only thing that was missing , but the female values of compassion , is @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Our society needs a national dialogue and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ as they needed the elections , which has to end up the @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Our society needs to invent the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the more than they use it , which is the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We need to stop in the name of the @@UNKNOWN@@ and act on a day .
We need to start in the name of compassion and compassion .
We need to have a female culture that 's not the same values , not only , but also , of course , rather than instead , collaboration , rather than @@UNKNOWN@@ , rather than instead .
These are the @@UNKNOWN@@ who are going to talk about the war - @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , to peace peace .
Because the peace has one of them , and in this case , the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That 's true true .
And that 's what we need to do before we do it .
After a quote from the Koran , " @@UNKNOWN@@ -- " -- the word of God 's God , @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
The word " @@UNKNOWN@@ " again , which is all in the collective tradition , which is the same way that the word " @@UNKNOWN@@ " -- " and the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is all of humanity ,
And exactly like the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the mouse that it 's growing up with him , completely @@UNKNOWN@@ so the @@UNKNOWN@@ of compassion .
So that 's why we said , " My @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ all the things . "
So that 's why we said , " My @@UNKNOWN@@ has an @@UNKNOWN@@ of my @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
In fact , all of the @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ have to be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Thank you very much .
When I was small , I thought , my country is the best of the world , and I grew up with the song " Nothing . "
And I was very proud .
In school school , we talked about the history of ancient @@UNKNOWN@@ -- but we did n't learn very much about the world because it was outside , America , South Korea and Japan are our enemies .
Even though I asked a question , like the outside world , I thought , I was going to take my entire life in North Korea , until I was all at the point .
With seven years ago , I looked at the first time , and I thought , my life in North Korea was normal .
My family was not poor , and I never had to be hungry .
But in the year in 2011 , my mother had a letter with the sister of a friend .
And then she said , " If you 're going to read this , we 're going to get our five members of our world , because we 've been eating two weeks ago .
We 're going on the ground and our bodies are so weak that we 're going to die .
I was so shocked .
I heard about the first time that people were in my country .
In the short , I went down to the door , and I saw something bad , which I do n't do any of my memory .
One woman woman on the ground , and a @@UNKNOWN@@ kid in her arm in her arm in the arm of his mother .
But nobody helped them because of all of this , so they were also trying to protect their families .
In the 1990s , there was a great famine in North Korea .
At the end , there were more than a million refugees of the poor to the victims , and lots of thousands of them , because they eat , @@UNKNOWN@@ and eat .
@@UNKNOWN@@ were always more likely to go down at night and all of me , except the lights of China on the other side of the @@UNKNOWN@@ that we 're living in .
I asked myself , why they got lights and we did n't .
This is a photograph of North Korea and his neighbors at night .
This is the river , which is part of the border between North Korea and China .
As you can see , the flow of @@UNKNOWN@@ is very @@UNKNOWN@@ , and it allows the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But many die .
Sometimes I saw them in the river .
I ca n't tell you much about it , as I North North Korea , but I can say that I 've been @@UNKNOWN@@ during the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the 1960s that killed killed to China .
I just thought I was a short time of my family .
I never thought that it was 14 years ago to go back .
In China , it was very hard to work as young young than no girl .
I did n't have an idea of how the life as a @@UNKNOWN@@ camp , but soon , I learned that it 's not just extremely difficult , but it 's very dangerous . Because @@UNKNOWN@@ refugees in China than
So I lived in a fear that my real identity identity could be , and you would say me in a terrible sentence for North Korea .
One day I was going to be the worst worst thing , when I was caught by the Chinese police , and in the front of the police to the police system .
Someone asked me to be @@UNKNOWN@@ , so they asked my @@UNKNOWN@@ and asked me to ask questions .
I was afraid that I thought was my heart .
Would something that seems to be @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I 'll be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I thought that would be the end of my life , but I made it to my emotions and control the questions .
After they were done with the @@UNKNOWN@@ , she was a @@UNKNOWN@@ to others , " That was a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's not an @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
And they did me . It was a miracle .
Some of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in China in foreign aid , but a lot of people who are killed by the police police and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
These girls were very lucky .
Even though they were caught , they were finally discovered because of international international aid .
These @@UNKNOWN@@ were not so much lucky .
Every year , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in China , and they came up to North Korea , where they were @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ or @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Even though I was lucky , I 've got lots of others .
It 's tragic that people have to protect their identity and hard to fight for survival .
Even after they found a new language and work , they can find their world in a moment on the head .
After 10 years ago , I decided to go back to South Korea , and I started a new life .
I was in South Korea , a bigger challenge when I thought it .
English was in South Korea , so important that I started to use my third language .
And also , I have the big difference between North and South Korea .
We 're all @@UNKNOWN@@ , but in the inside of us , we have a lot of @@UNKNOWN@@ , because of the last year .
I started a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Am I @@UNKNOWN@@ or @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
How do I come from ? Who am I ?
Suddenly there was no country that my home should be .
Even though the @@UNKNOWN@@ of life was not easy , I had a plan .
I was @@UNKNOWN@@ for the University of university .
And when I came to my new life , I got a @@UNKNOWN@@ call .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ were running the money that I sent my family , and as a punishment became my family , @@UNKNOWN@@ , on a remote place on the country .
They had to do so fast as soon as possible , so I started to open their own .
@@UNKNOWN@@ have an incredible route on their way to freedom .
It 's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea , and I took an airplane back to China and made me on the path to the border .
Because my family did n't talk to Chinese Chinese , and I had to lead them to more than 2,000 miles across China and then .
The bus took a week , and we 've been caught up with several times .
One year when the bus stopped , it was a Chinese girl .
He took the @@UNKNOWN@@ of all , and started asking questions .
Because my family did n't understand Chinese Chinese , I thought , would be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
When the Chinese @@UNKNOWN@@ my family told me , I decided decided to work on , and he told him that they would be @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I would be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He looked at me , but he believed me .
We took it up to the @@UNKNOWN@@ border , but I had to use all of my money to @@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But even after we had the border , it was my family , because of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
After I @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ paid , my family within a month , but the moment I was going to meet my family back in the capital of capital .
That was one of the largest most of my life .
I had all done to make my family with freedom , and we were so close to it , but my family was @@UNKNOWN@@ , just after the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the message .
I went and go between the @@UNKNOWN@@ and the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I was trying to @@UNKNOWN@@ my family , but I did n't have enough money to @@UNKNOWN@@ back and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I lost all my hope .
I asked the voice of a man , " What 's going on ? "
I was completely surprised that he was a stranger .
In English English and with a dictionary , I told my situation , and without @@UNKNOWN@@ , he went to a @@UNKNOWN@@ , and paid the money for my family and two other people to get out of the prison
I @@UNKNOWN@@ him from my heart and asked , " Why do you help me ? "
" I do n't help you , " he said .
" I 'm going to help people . "
I realized that this was an extraordinary moment in my life .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ stranger , for me , a new hope that the @@UNKNOWN@@ were so hard , and he showed up with the @@UNKNOWN@@ of strangers and the support of the international community as the @@UNKNOWN@@ that need to be
And finally , after our long journey , my family and I came back in South Africa , but the freedom itself is just a step .
Many of them are separated from their families , and once they go into a new country , they 're going to do it with little or no money .
The international community can help us with education , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ and a lot more .
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea , and the outside world , because many of us are still being connected with touch , and we send them information and money , and it 's
I had so lucky to be a lot of help and inspiration in my life that I want to be able to lead to success .
I 'm sure you 're going to have a lot of successful successful on the world , and at the stage of TED .
Thank you very much .
I have just one please .
Please tell me that I 'm normal .
I want to introduce my brothers .
@@UNKNOWN@@ is 22 , big and very popular .
He ca n't speak , but he can enjoy joy in a way , like some of the best words .
@@UNKNOWN@@ knows what love is .
He @@UNKNOWN@@ them and he @@UNKNOWN@@ it .
He 's not .
He does n't care about religious people , and imagine all of them , he never told a lie .
If he played songs from our childhood , which is not about words that I do n't even remember that he reminds me of a thing : how little things we know about the same thing , and how wonderful
@@UNKNOWN@@ is 16 . He 's big . He 's very popular .
He has an absolutely @@UNKNOWN@@ memory .
He also has a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He ca n't remember if he took my @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , but he reminds that of the song of every song on my iPod , conversations that we had , when he was four , while the first result of
Do n't hear that incredible ?
But many people do n't agree .
And actually , because their minds do n't look at the social version of normal , and they often often get up and wrong .
But what my heart changed and my soul , and that , although that was the case , even though they were n't normal , and that was just one thing that they were extraordinary -- that 's extraordinary and
Now , for those of you who do n't familiar with the term " autism , it 's a complex structure of the brain , the social communication , learning learning and sometimes @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It turns out to each individual , which is so different than Sam .
And the world is going to 20 20 minutes in a new person , and even though it 's one of the world 's growing growing - up in the world , there 's not a lot of information or
And I ca n't remember that the first time when I met autism , but I ca n't remember my day .
I was just three years old when my brother was born , and I was so excited that I had a new world in my life .
And after a few months , I realized that he was different .
He @@UNKNOWN@@ very much .
He did n't want to play the other babies , and actually , he actually did n't really interested in it .
@@UNKNOWN@@ lived and @@UNKNOWN@@ in his own world , with his own rules , and he thought joy about the tiny things , like about the cars in a series in the room to make the washing machine , and
And when he was older , and he became different and the differences were going .
But behind the @@UNKNOWN@@ and the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and the only thing to do it was something that was really unique , and it 's a nature and ordinary nature , a boy who did n't see the world without
@@UNKNOWN@@ .
Now , I ca n't argue that there were some moments moments in my family , moments , I wish that they were exactly what I was like .
But I 'm going to go back to the things that they taught me about talking , communication and love , and I understand that this is things that I do n't want to change against war .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , the beauty , the differences of us , and the fact that we are different , it does n't mean that one of us wrong .
It just means that there 's a different kind of thing .
And if I just had one thing to say , and you can be able to be able to be able to give up , and I would be that you have to be normal .
You can be extraordinary .
Because , autism or not , we have the differences that we have -- we have a gift -- everyone of us has a gift in it , and in all of us , the pursuit of @@UNKNOWN@@ is the
The chance of scale , progress and change in the moment that we 're trying to be someone else .
Please -- tell me that I 'm normal .
Thank you .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ with us , with curiosity and curiosity , with this photograph on a @@UNKNOWN@@ with an apple and a @@UNKNOWN@@ of just a second second .
But now , 50 years later , we 're a million times faster and look at the world , with a million or a billion , but a trillion trillion per second .
I 'm going to give you a new way of photography , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , a new @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is so fast that they can make light light into motion .
And so we can build cameras out of the @@UNKNOWN@@ of our @@UNKNOWN@@ , or without an X - ray in our body , and really , in a question , what we do with the camera .
Now , if I 'm going to take a laser and take it into a @@UNKNOWN@@ second , and @@UNKNOWN@@ -- this is several @@UNKNOWN@@ -- I 'm going to make a @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is a tiny
So , if you 're going to get this @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and it 's going to get into this bottle , how are these @@UNKNOWN@@ in the bottle ?
How does light slow motion ?
So , this whole event .
So , think about this whole event , it 's less less than a @@UNKNOWN@@ -- so long it takes the light around the @@UNKNOWN@@ , so that you can see the light in motion .
No , Coca - Cola does n't research this research .
So , in this movie , very much , so let me show you what this happens .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ , our @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is in the bottle of a @@UNKNOWN@@ , which starts to move through the process , and then eventually it down .
A part of the light on the outside of the table , and you can see this spread of waves .
There 's a lot of the @@UNKNOWN@@ in the end of the bottle of the bottle , and they 're moving into different directions .
As you can see , there 's a bubble that bottle in the bottle .
In the same way , the waves look at the table , and because of the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the top , you see that the @@UNKNOWN@@ are at the end of the bottle for a few pictures .
Now , if you take a @@UNKNOWN@@ , and it does the same run , and the video is going to stop the amount of 10 billion , you know , how long you have to sit here to see
One day , a week ? No , a whole year .
That would be a very boring film -- -- about a slow , normal @@UNKNOWN@@ in motion .
And how do something else - like photography .
You can see , like this waves , the @@UNKNOWN@@ and the wall in the background .
It 's like when you make a rock in a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And I found it as if the nature would take a photograph of each other image , but one of the eye , but we do n't look at the eye .
But if you look at this @@UNKNOWN@@ , you 'll notice that when the light gets the light , you 're going to go down , but you wo n't be dark .
Why is that ? Because the @@UNKNOWN@@ is right now , and light light into your foot , and after some @@UNKNOWN@@ seconds go back .
So , in the future , if this is the camera camera in your @@UNKNOWN@@ , it can be possible that you can go into a supermarket , and you can see if you 're going to be able to
So how did my team at MIT this camera ?
So , as a meeting , you know , if you take a photograph with a short - term short , you have very little light , but we @@UNKNOWN@@ a billion times faster than your @@UNKNOWN@@ , so you
So we 're going to do this . We send this @@UNKNOWN@@ , this @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I draw it back and very quickly , and we 're using this @@UNKNOWN@@ of data , to create these
And we can take all these data and take very interesting things .
So , Jesus can fly .
Some of us can make invisible invisible , but how would it be with a new design for a future that we can see ?
The idea is that we put something light on the door .
It 's going to go back into the room , a part of that will go back to the door , and eventually we go back to the camera , and we could have this @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of light .
And this is not a science fiction . We 've created it .
On the left hand , our camera camera .
@@UNKNOWN@@ the wall is a @@UNKNOWN@@ , and we 'll see the light on the door .
After our paper in the @@UNKNOWN@@ , it was published by @@UNKNOWN@@ and they created these animation .
We 're going to get this light light @@UNKNOWN@@ , and they 're going to get into this wall , and it 's going to be able to be able to be able to get this @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in all
And because we have a camera that 's so fast -- our camera camera has some of our abilities .
She has a very good @@UNKNOWN@@ , and you can see the world at the speed of light .
And this , of course , of course , of course , is the distance to the door , but also the thing that we do , but we do n't know what 's going to be at the point
And we can make a laser laser , and we can take a satellite image , which -- as they look at the screen -- does n't really make sense , but when we put a lot of these images
Can we see it in 3D 3D ?
So this is our @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We 've got a little bit to do before we can do this from the lab in the practice that we could make cars , and we can see the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and we can see what 's the curve
But because of the blood tissue tissue , and of course , this is very hard , so that 's really a @@UNKNOWN@@ call for scientists , now we 're thinking about @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , because there 's a new
So , like @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , even a scientist , the science has been art art , art art , and we can also create a scientist , and I realized that all of these @@UNKNOWN@@ of data that we
But it 's also something that happened .
If you look at these waves under the @@UNKNOWN@@ , you see that the waves are moving away .
The waves should be moving .
What happens here ?
It turns out that we 've been able to see almost light at the speed of light , all the effects effects , and Einstein would have seen this image .
The way that in the events in the world is going to happen in the camera in order , so that you 're able to make the same relationship between space and time , we can do that .
So , for example , whether it 's moving around the outside of the world or the world of a new design system for medicine , or new @@UNKNOWN@@ , since our invention , we have all the data and
It 's about time . Thank you .
There are many ways of how our human lives can make better life .
We do n't meet all of the neighbors on the street , so many people are not going to go back , but we use the same public places .
In the last few years , I tried to share more with my neighbors and share things like @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The projects came from my questions , like , how much women pay my neighbors ?
How can we make more things without without each other ?
How can we bring our memories back to the building buildings and understand the landscape ?
And how do we share our hope for our homes for our homes for our homes , so our communities need our needs and our dreams and dreams ?
I live in New York , and I love New York .
My soul is @@UNKNOWN@@ by the giant @@UNKNOWN@@ of the time , and hundreds of years ago , @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ . I trust a city where there is always music .
I think every time in someone , is there in New York .
In this city , some of the most beautiful buildings of the world , but it 's also the city with most of the most vulnerable in America .
I live in the middle of this house , and I thought , as I think it can be @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I thought to something that changed my life forever .
In 2009 , I lost someone I loved .
Her name was @@UNKNOWN@@ and she was like a mother for me , and death death and suddenly .
I have a lot more about death , and I felt a great grateful for my life , and it took me to think about the things that I 'm going to think about in life .
But it 's hard to realize this view every day .
It 's easy to keep in life on the day , and to forget what 's really important .
With the help of old and new friends , I got a page of the @@UNKNOWN@@ of a house , and I wrote with a @@UNKNOWN@@ that would say , " Before I die , I want to say --
I was n't sure what I could do with this experiment , but on the next day , the wall was completely @@UNKNOWN@@ and she grew up .
I want to play a couple of different things that people wrote to the wall .
" Before I die , I 'd like to be @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
" Before I die , I 'd like to call @@UNKNOWN@@ about the International @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
" Before I die , I want to sing for millions of people . "
" Before I die , I want to see a tree . "
" Before I die , I want to live " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
" Before I die , I want to keep it in my poor . "
" Before I die , I want to be someone 's someone . "
" Before I die , I want to be myself . "
This was a place that was going to be a very important place , and the dreams and dreams of the people brought me to laugh and feel like the hard times .
It 's about to know that you 're not alone .
It 's about to make our neighbors and understand it in a new way , and a way .
It 's about taking place for @@UNKNOWN@@ and to think of thinking , and remember , what we 're most important is when we grow and growing up .
I 've done this last year , and I 've got a lot of messages from global people who have created a community , and so my colleagues , and I made a building , and now we 've been
We have shown how much power our public places have when we have the opportunity to change our voices and more with others with others .
Two of the most remarkable things we have , and time relationships relationships with other people .
In a world with a lot of politicians , it 's more important than ever before the things look at the right view , and think of thinking about life , and it 's like .
We 're going to talk about how to talk about death , and also just to think of it , but I realized that the @@UNKNOWN@@ on the death is one of the things that most of us is most
The idea of death death .
Our common places show us how best as individuals and the community is important . And with more opportunities to our hope , our fears , our stories , and the people share with us to help us not only
Thank you .
Thank you .
So , I 'm going to do with mathematics mathematics . It 's a special problem for each of the mathematics of mathematics , that we 're like @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Nobody knows what we actually do .
That 's why I 'm going to try to explain today what I do .
@@UNKNOWN@@ is one of the activities activities .
We 're looking at the head of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ , like you can see .
It 's an extraordinary amount of high - term skills and skills , and perhaps a basic thing that might have a genetic component .
Unfortunately , @@UNKNOWN@@ diseases like Alzheimer 's disease has this ability ability to do it .
Over the years , you have a lot of progress in the treatment .
Yet , there 's a million million people who have the disease of this disease , and they need to have to be similar to the @@UNKNOWN@@ , like @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , other people , and other people who
We need to measure the evolution of gravity , and finally , the only way we can really understand whether it 's a cure if we have a @@UNKNOWN@@ , that can answer that question .
@@UNKNOWN@@ is that it 's for Alzheimer and other @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , you ca n't do simple simple , you can do it . The best thing is there is this @@UNKNOWN@@ test .
You have to do it in the hospital . It 's very expensive , and this does n't happen outside the clinical studies that never ever done .
But what if patients could do this test at home ?
That would be a @@UNKNOWN@@ trip to the hospital . What if the patients could do this test ?
It would n't need to be expensive .
It costs about 300 dollars to study in terms of the health .
So , I want to give you an example of the way that we 're trying to do that , because we all are , in a certain sense , as my @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Here you see a video of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This happens in the normal condition , if someone 's @@UNKNOWN@@ , we can look at @@UNKNOWN@@ as well as we 're @@UNKNOWN@@ , because we have to have all these @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , if we have sound , and
And how do it requires a lot of practice .
Think about how long a child needs to talk to it .
By the way we can see the position of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and as the @@UNKNOWN@@ are also the @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
On the bottom , you can see an example of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We see the same symptoms .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The language is going to go back to the time , and it 's a @@UNKNOWN@@ for it .
This impact on the voice can be @@UNKNOWN@@ , sometimes , but with digital @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ software software , with learning learning , this is very early now , so we can see exactly where someone is in a
How can we do this test with clinical trials ? Well , they 're both non - @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's also similar . The infrastructure is there .
You do n't have to build a new hospitals .
And both of them are accurate .
So you can do it .
They 're very fast , take 30 seconds .
They 're very cheap and we know what this means .
If it 's extremely extremely cheap , you can do it in a very scale .
These amazing targets we can do now .
We can reduce trouble for patients .
patients have no need to go into the hospital .
We can create an idea of data .
We can do low - term experiments for clinical trials , and first a study of the entire population .
We now have the possibility of first time to test for the disease before it 's too late .
Today we do the first step into this direction , we start the @@UNKNOWN@@ voice .
With @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ , we want to have a very high number of voices in the world , to have enough to have enough to have , for the least of those targets .
We have @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is a billion people on this planet .
Everybody , with a heart disease , you ca n't call it a little bit of data that 's going to give you a few minutes , and I 'm talking about joy that we already have six percent of
Thank you .
If you give us some of us , we can make 10,000 people , and you can say , who are healthy and not ?
What are you going to do with you ?
So what happens is that the patient 's going to talk to the patient 's brain , whether it 's a heart disease or not .
Some of them may not be until the end of the end .
But we collect a lot of a database database , in different circumstances , which is interesting , and the circumstances are important , because we are , these @@UNKNOWN@@ , to see that what the actual properties are for
Right ?
It 's much better .
My student @@UNKNOWN@@ -- I have to do it because he 's doing this incredible work -- it 's shown that it also works on the @@UNKNOWN@@ system , which is this project , and we 're at 99 percent
That 's what I call .
That means that people can -- people can do with the cell phone and the test , and with the test .
Right .
Thank you very much . @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , ladies and gentlemen .
Thank you , Tom .
Here I live . I live in Kenya in the south of the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the national park .
In the background , you see the cows of my father and the behind is the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the National Park .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ of National Park is in the south of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , which means that the way that you can get to the park in the park .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ , the lions , they follow them , and then they do this .
They kill our ocean .
That 's one of our cows , which was at night in the night , and I was in the morning , and she was dead . It was terrible . It was our only @@UNKNOWN@@ .
My sister , the tribe of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , we believe that we can connect together with our animals and the @@UNKNOWN@@ from the sky .
Just as a child , I learned to hate lions .
Our grandmother are called @@UNKNOWN@@ . They protect our tribe and our @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And kill the lions .
Here 's one of six lions that were killed in each of those .
And I believe that there 's a @@UNKNOWN@@ in the national park , which is so small there .
In my tribe , it 's a boy between six and nine years ago for the cows of his father .
I had to find a solution .
My first idea was fire .
But then I realized that this would n't help us not to help , but the lions help to see the cows .
But I did n't . I kept on .
I had a second idea . I tried to do it with a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I wanted to say that the lions thought I was going to be next .
But lions are very smart animals .
They come up and see the @@UNKNOWN@@ and go back again , and the next time , but they 're going to say , and that 's not the same thing , but it 's not the same thing ,
And they go down and kill our blood .
One night , I was going to go to the front . I walked with a @@UNKNOWN@@ in the hand around him , and I did n't have the lions .
@@UNKNOWN@@ fear to light .
I had an idea .
And as a young boy , I worked all the day in my room , and I even had to see the new radio of my mother , and the day she took me almost a little bit about high
I took an old - year - old and a half - a - half - year - old . You can see if you want to go on the right , right left . He goes .
And I got a switch to get the lights out and get rid of it .
This is a little bit of a broken @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And then I built everything together .
The solar @@UNKNOWN@@ the battery that battery battery on the @@UNKNOWN@@ . I call it a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
You can see that the light comes from the outside , because there are the lions .
And this looks like the lions when they come .
The lights are @@UNKNOWN@@ and the lions believe that I 'm going to go to the outside , and I was the whole time in bed .
Thank you .
I 've done this time with us at home , and we 've had no problems with lions .
And then listen our neighbors .
One of them was this grandmother .
She had a lot of their animals lost lions , and she asked me if I could put them up .
And I said , " Yeah . "
I had the lights . You can see the @@UNKNOWN@@ in the background .
And since I 've got seven homes in the neighborhood , and they @@UNKNOWN@@ very well .
My idea is going to be in Kenya , also for others , like @@UNKNOWN@@ or @@UNKNOWN@@ .
My invention gave me a letter to one of the best schools in Kenya , @@UNKNOWN@@ International , and I 'm really excited .
My new school became a lot of education and education .
I even brought my friends with home , and together we put the lights there , where there 's no one , and I 'll show you the people that you use .
A year ago , I was just a boy from the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the father of my dad cows , and I looked like me , and I said , " One day I 'm going to sit in a
And here I am .
I had to do with an airplane airplane for my first TED .
If I want to be big , I want to be @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I 'm going to get up .
I used to see lions . But by my invention , I can save the cows of my father and the dolphins . We can live in the side of the side , with the lions , without war .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
You do n't know how exciting it is , a story like you hear .
So you did this .
You work with other electric ideas .
What 's the next on the list ?
So my next invention , I 'm working on an electric grid .
Yeah , I know , electric @@UNKNOWN@@ have been done before , but I want to have my own .
You 've done it , again , right -- yes , I 've been trying to do that , but then trying to give it back , because I got a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In the beginning , it 's hard . Richard @@UNKNOWN@@ , you 're very special .
We 're going to take you at every step of your journey , my friend .
Thank you very much .
For me , I 've got enough to have a camera in my hand , so I have my passion today , but today I want to share with you with my 15 and a half one of them .
There was no way , no @@UNKNOWN@@ , not a chance to make a picture again , not even the light .
In order to be honest , most of them were killed by @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
My story starts as I started for a talk in New York , and my wife 's image this image , which I was my daughter on her first birthday on my arm . We were on the corner of
It was a year later , and we launched back in New York , and so we decided to make the same picture again .
Well , you can see what 's going on .
When I was the third birthday of my daughter , my wife said , " Hey , why do n't you @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ from New York , and I 'd like to have a father - old daughter to make
At the time we started to @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , to see a picture of us .
You know , it 's remarkable , which is the universal thing as if you 're a completely stranger with his camera .
Nobody ever said no , and that happiness is still not someone with our camera .
At that time , we did n't know how much this journey would change our lives .
This journey has become very beautiful .
This was just taken weeks after 9/11 , and I had to explain what happened in the day , so that a kid can understand it .
These images are much more than just a moment , or a tiny journey .
They 're also a chance for a week for October a day , and we think about our time , and how we change us from year , not only to live in it , but it 's something that
Because although we always do the same picture , it changes our perspective from time , while they always have to be new new ways , I can make life with their eyes , and how it works with everything
It 's a very emotional time that we 're talking about something that we value and every year .
So , after a few days , we walked on a night , and suddenly it came up with me , like @@UNKNOWN@@ , they show up a red @@UNKNOWN@@ of a @@UNKNOWN@@ that she had as a little kid
And she told me about their feelings that she had as a five - year ago .
She said that she reminds that of her the heart from the chest , when she was nine years ago at the store .
And now what she looks in New York after school , because they 're going to study in New York .
And I realized that the most important thing we 're going to do is memories .
And so I want to share with you with the idea , an active role in the visual process of memories .
I do n't know what it looks like you , but yet from those 15 images , I 'm barely a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I 'm always one of the image .
So I want to talk to you today , with the image , and you do n't ask someone to say , " Would you make a picture of us ? "
Thank you very much .
