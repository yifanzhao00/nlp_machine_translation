My goal in this video and the next thing .
One of the size of the Earth is just like the Earth .
And the solar system , and as we can see .
When we look at the galaxy and the universe .
It 's almost impossible to change all this .
But we 're going to try it .
Well , well , I think that most of you know this video .
That 's the Earth is Earth .
This is the Earth .
And just in a sense of that , you think , I think .
That 's the biggest part that we can imagine .
It 's probably about 100 miles .
You can go to a car , and an hour , maybe a few hours .
And about 100 miles away .
On the Earth , it would be about unk .
That would be a point where it would look like this .
These are 100 miles .
And also , we just get a little bit more .
We 're thinking about a speed that we can imagine .
And that maybe maybe the speed of ...
Let 's think about the speed ...
One unk . The speed of a crash .
Maybe we can not imagine .
But let 's say that this is the ocean that we might imagine .
And that 's about ...
Narrator : And there 's a couple of different guys .
unk of the unk and all of this .
It 's about 30 feet per second .
What about 1,000 miles .
And that 's about the speed of a unk .
One unk ...
So , just to give a sense of the energy , the planet Earth .
If you could go on the planet .
The unk , here , is about 40 years .
40 miles ...
So if you go to the speed of a plane .
The speed of a balloon .
Or the speed of a unk unk , 1,000 miles .
It would have to take it to the Earth .
40 hours to get the Earth .
And you think it does n't have this information .
You may have seen a unk or unk unk .
The one is not even the Earth .
But it 's pretty far .
In San Francisco , or something .
So these are not so crazy .
And even though , for me , was the Earth itself .
It 's an amazing object .
Well , with me , that 's what we 're thinking about .
The sun .
Because the sun is a little bigger .
So that 's here , there 's obvious to the sun .
And I think most of the most people know that the sun comes up is larger than the Earth .
And also , it 's pretty far from the Earth .
But I think many people I have .
You do n't understand completely unk , the big sun , or unk , far from the Earth .
And just to get a sense of that , the sun has already .
unk unk unk on Earth .
unk unk unk on Earth .
So if we could do something like this .
When we say , " OK , I 'm going to go through the speed of a plane or a unk .
It would be unk to Earth .
Now , how long , would it be the sun ?
So when I 'm going to go back to a foot , and try to understand the sun .
Or if I had to be able to find a unk , and we would try to see the sun .
It 's a full unk .
It would be .
So , as soon as soon as the Earth Earth .
So , it would be 100 100 years ago , and I was able to do it , but I was just as unk .
It 's about 100 to the unk of the Earth .
So , 100 100 miles unk
unk unk !
And only to be a sense of how much more unk are .
I 've got to buy the unk .
Let 's do that .
These are unk unk unk Earth .
unk unk unk .
This is like a long time to get the Earth .
So these are unk unk to fly the sun .
And that 's the speed of a unk !
And this is " unk unk day . "
These are unk days .
This is a half - year year .
It would take a half a year to come from the sun , at the speed of a plane .
That 's what we call it .
A half year .
A half year ...
The sun is unk !
The sun is huge .
Well , it 's not like that , but it 's not so unusual .
In fact , let me give you a little bit of size .
I have this diagram from the sun .
This is another diagram of the sun .
We 're going to look at the next video more than the rest of the solar system .
But over over here , this scale , this is the sun .
The sun , at least in my screen if they were completely completely .
It would be unk in unk .
The Earth is just the little thing over here .
unk , smaller than a unk .
Just the little thing over here .
If I look at unk unk , where the sun is actually , it would be even more small smaller .
The Earth would be like ...
The Earth would be so big .
Well , obviously , obviously not obvious .
We all have these unk unk in the unk and unk class .
So , " You know , we 'll see these two of the solar system that look like this .
But the planet are unk away .
Even though these objects objects .
unk unk unk , they are unk away from the sun .
So , the sun , of course . unk , the Earth is 150 million miles from the sun .
So the Earth is .
This is how much the sun would be here .
When the sun would be here , you would .
Over the size of the Earth , there was more unk !
You would n't see the Earth .
unk unk .
But it was 150 150 , it was 150 150 years .
150 thousand miles on Earth .
And this one is called unk unk .
We 're going to use this expression in the next few days .
Just just because it 's much easier to think about it .
Sometimes " unk " unk , " unk unk . "
unk ...
unk ...
And just to be a sense of how far as it is .
light , what we know is almost as fast .
That 's sometimes sometimes .
It takes seven minutes to come from the sun on Earth .
When the sun comes up , it would have to eight eight minutes .
So we have on Earth on Earth , the sun has gone .
Or different , let 's go back .
And let 's go back .
So we have 100 , we talk about 150 years .
These are a hundred million dollars !
These are 150 million miles .
So if we look at 1,000 miles .
So we were going to unk with 1,000 dollars , which we would like .
150 unk , at the speed of a plane or a unk .
It comes to the sun , and it 's just to change in perspective .
If you go to the morning , there are unk unk day .
That would be unk unk days , then we share the process of thousands of days ago .
About 17 years !
If we have a unk unk to the sun , it would have 17 years to get there !
If we could measure the speed of light .
A single one or a unk , would have to go down to the sun .
17 ...
17 years ...
Or another way to do it .
The sun comes up here is about five or six minutes .
If we 're going to look at this in perspective .
Then this is a little point here where the Earth is unk .
That point .
If you could go back in unk feet .
And then this would be unk away from the sun .
50 - foot - foot feet -- 18 minutes away from the sun .
If you look at the solar system .
And of course , there are other things in the solar system .
But we talk about the next video .
And then you would have these dots dots -- it 's just a little bit of the sun .
And if we go further and go back to the solar system .
We 're going to see even more unk .
Or a different perspective .
If the sun had the size .
If the sun is so big here .
When then the point here , the Earth would have been in this size .
Then it would be about 50 feet 60 feet away .
You can imagine a unk .
If you could have a unk ...
I 'm going to make a unk .
And then there are the unk down .
A unk , another unk .
If you 're here a little bit of something , you know , in a size , maybe a unk .
A little bit more than a unk , which is a unk .
And this little point that would be 60 miles far away , that 's about 60 years .
You would put it in a unk !
Something of the size .
Anyway , I unk it , and I hope .
They have to be unk with this one of the sun .
The Earth , and as far as the Earth comes from the sun .
And if we look at the time , there are even more times more than that .
It 's small if you look at the rest of the solar system .
And especially when you look at the solar system .
Our goal is to make it better .
And the users are the answers to the answers .
And faster faster .
That 's almost a unk .
between the idea and the user users .
And the unk unk .
Google was working on the basis of an algorithm .
The unk of unk and unk in Stanford .
It 's called the unk algorithm .
On the foundation of the signal , the two of them .
It 's a completely unk form .
At that time .
unk the unk .
It never never had a unk .
unk .
And it was always harder .
They want to create the content .
unk .
First of all , Google unk .
Not a paper .
And as we started , we started to click .
It should n't necessarily be true .
It 's important to look like the unk .
And also also had to go back to the unk .
To be different .
From the beginning , there was a clear vision .
And between eight and the search .
The search for a single goal .
This is the unk of the information .
That 's how fast as possible .
unk .
In 2000 , 2000 , 2000 , we had a structure .
It 's wonderful .
We were working on for unk .
When you Google Google .
And then better , it was better .
It also grew up .
They did n't want to be online .
They wanted to be able to show the data .
It 's a picture or a book .
That 's how we started , and new unk .
In the search .
The first thing was the unk .
A picture is more than a thousand words .
So we asked the user users .
Which is " unk . "
And they gave " unk " as a unk .
This question you can only .
unk with a question .
After the events of 9/11 .
They were our users from Google unk .
They were looking for New York City .
And we 've never had a lot of information in our results .
That 's the heart of this day .
There 's a half - year - old unk .
And of course , of course , we do n't have a good news .
So we 've got on the left - hand side of the city .
And on our hand , we 're going to call a user and our users .
unk on these networks .
Because our search was not not .
I was back with my friend unk .
It was on a conference and 2002 .
" If we go back to the unk .
And we have three different neurons .
The same thing I could show .
Is n't that great ? "
This was the birth of Google .
Our special unk .
By 2002 , the Web was on the Web .
unk and more and more .
unk more images , unk content .
Our users are from Google Google .
They have all of the things in the Web .
Anyway , no text , a website or a message .
Everything should be able to be able to find it .
So we came up with the idea of freedom .
You should be able to do anything about Google .
Do n't matter what kind of content content .
It 's true .
A problem in the answer is not .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
They 're going to look like a chimpanzee .
And a picture would be a yellow .
unk unk images .
Let 's the unk .
The size of the picture and the number of dots .
Is it black black or white ?
All these signals are just images for images .
Not not to be online .
And that was the development .
The answer was so difficult .
And finally , it ended up the results .
unk on the side of the side , down to the side side .
It 's going to be somewhere in the middle .
We have the idea .
Do n't have to be able to see .
unk in different areas .
Over the years .
We have a big step further .
Today we show .
There are different types of information .
unk the unk .
Because our algorithms are better .
unk solutions .
With our unk , the user can see the same .
Which they want .
And the results are so fast .
And the users are not even aware .
And he had never seen a unk .
Actually , it would have been beginning .
That should be .
If you look for a certain information .
It 's trying to Google Google .
unk our unk .
For example : unk .
They want to look at unk .
Or , like , at the unk Institute ?
We want you to Google Google .
So as fast as possible , we can find the information .
In Google , you have n't even once again .
The unk unk unk .
You do n't have to have to focus on .
You can use for example , " unk . "
And we 're looking at the results .
And before you 've thought about your mind .
The future itself .
Basically , we 're moving beyond the borders .
The interaction of an interaction .
unk with the engine .
The way you can look at images from the picture itself .
It 's more than unk .
Our users are now today .
unk .
My dream was always a star - made .
I could be able to do .
My computer is : "
" When I go back to the early year .
With the unk in India ? "
Once we have to answer this question .
Which is not the case of the case .
We want to be able to win .
It 's more more complex solutions .
There 's a real unk .
unk questions , if they were Google Google .
Our users have more knowledge knowledge .
And they are more interested in the unk .
Welcome to the unk of unk .
unk for unk unk .
unk your foot around the machine .
Of course , the unk of the unk could be unk .
unk you can see a digital camera .
And the unk of your data .
And then you get the power and air is connected .
That 's the machine , and the connections are unk .
unk unk is unk unk .
For the electric car , the machine machine .
unk unk .
unk unk and unk unk .
unk of unk unk unk .
And these unk unk unk unk .
unk unk on the computer computers .
The need to have a unk .
And at least one , or 13 percent .
That 's the source of the machine .
The unk is unk with the unk .
It 's a unk unk .
It 's going to be unk in the bottom of the surface of water .
And the performance of the machine in the conditions are unk .
And with the power and air in the place .
Let 's start with the machine unk .
unk the doors of the unk .
unk all the unk .
unk and unk boxes .
It 's inside the machine system .
It should be able to do this for the option .
And unk and unk with the machine .
unk , unk , if you all have all .
unk to create the unk .
unk the unk and you put it in the unk unk .
It 's about three parts of the brain control .
It 's going to send the roof .
And we need to be in the right place .
unk by unk from five to the six - dimensional unk .
Let 's take the left one on the left left , and then lose .
unk up to the unk unk .
And you take the water .
Let 's take the bottom of the bottom .
The unk unk and the yellow place for now .
This unk unk unk unk unk .
And you should be asked for the help of people .
Well , if you go to the unk in unk .
You 'll notice the unk to the unk .
And you 're sure that you are in a deep place .
In unk , the unk of the unk unk unk .
unk him down , down to the unk .
It 's certainly not a pair of electrical than the size .
unk in unk .
unk unk with the unk unk .
It can be sitting in the unk station .
It 's between the unk and the unk .
unk the rest of you , and you 're all unk .
And back to the roof of the roof .
unk unk unk unk .
I do n't want to create unk unk .
This is the unk of the machine and you take the unk unk .
It 's about unk or a different unk unk unk .
All of all the way in the way , is not a unk and other .
unk , with unk , unk .
The unk are in unk .
This is the unk of unk .
A pair of unk can be used to be able to move .
It 's very complex of unk .
Do n't be unk - unk , or unk unk .
This is going down to the unk .
Do you notice that this is not going to be down to the axis ?
After all , it was unk .
It 's going to be unk , unk .
unk with unk .
unk unk unk unk into the unk unk .
And you put it in the surface .
On the back of the machine .
The unk of air air has to do the machine .
If you look at the air air and the unk works .
In the inside of the machine , you get the unk on the unk .
unk the unk to the unk with a five - year - old unk .
The chip did not next .
unk the unk of unk unk unk unk .
Give you a little bit of unk unk unk .
and the unk .
Let 's slow down to the unk .
And the unk of the poetry poetry against unk .
When the unk is the unk unk unk .
It 's a good time to be unk .
Like the unk of unk and work .
On the bottom of the unk unk unk .
unk your unk work on the unk 's unk .
unk , more of the more unk , unk under the unk .
unk unk is on the end of the edge of unk .
That 's back to the unk and unk .
The unk is unk .
unk is both , and the unk is unk .
Let 's use a unk in unk .
unk unk the unk .
Each of these values on the future level .
Let 's go back to the edge of the stage .
And you follow these values .
Do n't have to be more than greater than .
The unk values .
Is there is a value , which is probably about high .
There 's a bad water or a unk .
unk unk system .
unk to the name of what you found .
If the values in order , you 'll take the device .
unk unk in the position , and do it .
It 's not a unk on the unk .
And the average of the sea level of the only thing that we 've just got down .
unk the unk of the average unk number .
Think about the unk and you call the unk .
unk the unk unk unk unk unk .
Now , you go back to the machine unk .
And movement on the unk , and you 're in power water .
On the back of the machine , to show the information .
unk from the U.S. unk is in unk .
At the unk with the machine machine .
Now , when the stage , the light is green .
A red light shows that the performance is unk .
Go to the unk of the energy in the unk .
And unk , come to the Mark unk , the unk .
Nobody does it .
You 're sure that the unk lines of the lines lines
And to make sure that there 's no way between it , before you lose .
unk the lines of the lines and unk unk unk .
After the machine , it 's got up to the control .
He 's unk , the machine unk unk screen screen .
unk the unk of the computer .
unk software .
unk .
And the unk .
The key key code is based on the code .
unk -- from a unk unk .
unk you on a set of paper .
unk the machine , as you go .
If you have information information .
They get the unk code for the unk machine .
Give you the key code code , and you write it .
The machine will be normal .
unk with unk unk unk .
It 's ready to unk .
unk all the colors of unk unk unk .
unk all the unk and unk unk .
They do n't build the machine with nothing more of the unk .
unk the unk of unk .
unk between the unk and the unk .
Let 's unk , the unk unk unk in the unk .
Now , this is the unk axis on top .
The unk unk , you go to zero zero .
And so on the vertical axis is moving up to the unk .
unk unk unk and the unk .
It 's going to be built by the machine .
The machine in our unk unk used to use the unk option .
And in this case , it was the unk unk unk .
For the unk unk system .
Now we start the machine process , the three things are .
First of all , the machine will be at the deep level of unk .
Secondly , the machine is unk unk , and back to the back .
After all , every day , or unk in the unk unk .
It 's going to be able to create the machine .
The level is unk unk .
In a video video in unk unk .
unk with the machine .
unk unk the unk .
Give the unk unk program , and then you get the memory memory .
Give your unk unk unk .
And you take a program .
unk unk , and the unk is going to 500 500 years ago .
In the United States , it was good for this program , the first one , the morning .
And when the computer was more than a few days ago .
unk the unk of the unk .
unk .
The unk .
And this is unk unk .
Now there 's a good time to get the unk and the sequence of components .
unk the unk unk unk unk unk .
unk the unk and unk unk .
And the unk of the walls is needed .
unk the unk unk unk unk .
unk the unk , and you put the unk unk .
In the unk of the unk unk unk unk .
So , if you have the right place , right ?
unk .
It 's full space on the right side .
unk unk is that the skin is good .
unk the connections with the machine machine .
unk water .
And the unk .
unk the unk line of unk unk .
unk for the unk .
unk your unk .
unk in the unk with the unk .
When the machine with a unk - unk , it 's an unk .
unk your unk .
The unk unk with the unk of the system .
unk the unk unk unk .
unk the unk unk on the unk .
And they connect the unk with the unk point on the phone .
When the unk unk unk , unk .
You ask for the U.S. unk .
And so the connections that were just done .
We can be able to be unk .
When they are waiting for the generation of the unk , they were unk .
It 's a good time to get back to the unk of unk .
Look at the unk , and you look at these numbers with you .
unk should n't be more than 10 or unk .
Five percent of your own values values that has been published .
If you ca n't look at the first one , you want to know the clients .
You can get some reason for you .
In this example , three months ago .
And three and three is on the ground level .
When the unk is full , you get part of the information system .
It 's not to have the connections .
Do you put the computer on the computer to create the code for this machine .
And you all unk unk .
And every option for unk .
And with the options , they have to unk the unk unk .
The unk is now .
And the machine is unk .
Thank you for your story at the unk unk unk .
I 'm going to tell you something about the last 30 years .
That 's very beautiful for 18 minutes .
It 's a complex model , so we 're going to go back to a complex place , New York .
Because 30 years ago , I was born as a six years ago in my friends in New York City , and that was my unk .
In the city of mine , I was the unk I did with my sister .
When I went back to the village , there was a unk with the living room .
There were all the way , looking at all , and I was looking at every time , when I went back into the house , and when I went
And I looked like this .
I was in unk , and I was unk .
I ended up this , I 'm going to leave this room and this house .
And this is architecture .
This feeling , my emotions , that 's the power of architecture , because in architecture , it 's not about mathematics and unk , it 's about the deep
And it does n't even know that we feel like that , because I mean , " [ unclear ] ] [ unk ] ] Americans , 90 percent of
So we are 90 percent of our time from architecture .
That 's huge .
It means that architecture is in a way that we do n't realize .
That makes us a unk and very serious .
So if I want to do a look like this , I know what you think , you think , " unk , " and " democracy . "
And you think this is because there was a building that was two million years ago .
This is a trick .
This one of the principles of being able to make sense of emotional connections to create the shapes that we built our buildings .
It 's an unk of unk , and we use this kind of a very long time .
We took the X - ray 200 years ago , in order to run out .
We took him in the 19th century .
In America in the 20th century , we built the house .
Look at these unk , unk cells , who are looking at the ocean and look at the unk .
This is very useful , because things are built to be scary .
It 's expensive , it takes long , and it 's very complicated .
People who are building -- -- and governments -- of course , of course , innovation , are using the shapes that are unk .
That leads to buildings like this .
This is a beautiful building .
But it does n't have a lot of what to do with a library .
In the same year ago , in 2004 , we went to the other side of the United States and the other library , and we looked like this .
This is in Spain .
In the library , it 's about the unk in the digital age .
It 's about a new kind of public space for the city , a place for the city , to read to how to study .
How is it possible , that in the same year , in the same two buildings , there are two things that are very different ?
architecture is based on a kind of unk .
On the side of the West , the architect are actually new technologies , new unk , new solutions that we live today .
We 're all going to be black , we 're very depressed . They 're looking for us , but we 're dead dead , because we have no choice
We have to move the page , and the unk are the ones that you have to love .
If we do that , and you 're happy , we feel like unk , so we 're going to do that , and we 're going to keep the
30 years ago , there was 30 years ago .
It 's an architect architect with what it called " unk . "
And it was about concrete .
unk light , unk .
That 's really hard stuff .
When we looked at the other 80s , we started to write these symbols .
We unk the unk back into the other direction .
We took the shapes , you like , and unk .
We were unk and unk , and we built a new material .
And you loved it .
They were not enough enough .
We took unk unk unk , and they were unk in unk , unk unk unk .
The shapes were big , and unk .
unk were unk .
It was crazy .
But these were the ' 80s , that was cool .
So this was in the unk .
It was like this .
They were just cheap , because there are places to create , we 've got memories in places .
I know , and I know you all know , that 's not the unk .
This is unk .
At the end of the ' 80s and the ' 90s , we called " unk . "
We were able to read the details of unk behind us , we went to the new unk , unk and unk , new forms of shapes , different forms
This was unk , and it was very , very much , we unk it .
Usually , it would just go back back .
But then something happened .
In 2002 , this building was built .
This is the unk of Frank Frank .
This building changed the world for architecture .
Paul unk was the unk of one of the moments moments in the unk , unk and the public people were in a different way .
The New York Times was built a building .
The unk grew up in two million dollars after after that was built .
He 's our first real unk .
How is it possible , that these shapes -- and unk -- how is it possible ?
And this happened , the media was going to be successful , and we realized that these shapes and unk .
These shapes called us an emotional response .
Just like in the global world .
Everybody who knew that these shapes and unk with them .
This phenomenon of unk has some other unk .
Think about your unk .
A few years ago , you would have to go to the village village to build a building .
The unk is unk . You take a boat , a plane , you know , as you look like a tree .
The technology is unk : You see it in paper , in the TV , we finally got all the unk , and the unk of the unk is from
architecture is everywhere now , which means that the speed of all the speed of architecture .
Because architecture is pretty fast .
It does n't work for a building .
But it takes a long time to build a building , three years , and four years , and in the process of an architect , two months , eight
That 's in the unk of a good " unk " in architecture .
That 's why we built this building .
This will never happen , I think , because we 're going to think about the biggest revolution in the history of the invention of unk , the unk of
In my theory , I think it 's always faster , when you 're in media media , but it 's almost at the same time , and they 're
Now , we can almost look at the unk of unk unk , which is completely different .
That 's going on a project that we 've recently recently .
We were unk to build this building buildings .
This is the center of a city called unk unk Island in the New York City .
It 's a unk .
And we built a unk building buildings , which was all of the things that we were talking about , and we were concerned about our clients , and the
That means that it was two years ago , a unk community of the community , there were exactly what they looked like , and they did n't have a
This building was a part of this community , and in the early summer , when people came and started to build the buildings in social media , it was
So we do n't have no words to tell us what we think about architecture .
We can tell each other to what we think about architecture , because the digital media is not only the relationship between us , and they changed the relationship between
Think about the unk in unk .
If the building buildings today , it would be next to be online , and they do n't come back . "
They would be able to look at an interesting map of unk , which is to go to the edge of the West , which is going to be a
This is unk .
This is unk that they have to go to the mayor and to tell the citizens of the day , to tell them , not just one answer to what
Be a part of that .
This has also been able to give them the freedom , their own experiment .
Everything has changed .
unk are not a unk , more and the big words , and you can use it , and you 're not the public health -- the consumer is not
You know , and architecture is not architecture .
That 's the end of the unk . This means that the future are different than the buildings are going to be .
It means that there is a public space in the city of unk and unique behavior in a modern city .
A unk in New York , there 's a unk in unk , and not just unk unk unk of our ideas from a unk .
unk are going to build our buildings , because we finally finally have to make them .
unk are going back to the unk of nature , rather than different .
A place in Spain , in Florida , Florida , can also be a place where you can do or unk , and you can go back to the night
That means that it 's not going to be a unk , it 's like innovation , like this little unk , which is the same unk and unk ,
So , a building is not really beautiful to be back to the way , like this little black in Spain , where the architect , a single hole ,
It does n't matter whether a cow is our buildings , or a robot our buildings .
It 's true , as we build , it 's just important what we 're building .
Now , you know , " unk , unk and unk buildings .
We 've just wait for you to do that .
Finally , we do n't have more on unk pages .
You find an architect , you know , an architect , do you want to create better buildings , and a better world , because it 's a lot of
In fact , not only our society , again , they 're going to go back to the very interesting place : the unk , your home , where your
Thank you .
This is my unk .
It became a year ago , and started started .
She 's going to be on this cool way like unk now , a unk , after the word " my body is too fast for my legs . "
It looks pretty cute .
And one of their unk is himself in the mirror .
She wants to unk .
It 's unk , unk , and there are these big , unk .
When does n't suddenly be okay , okay ?
Because apparently we do n't .
Every month of the unk people in Google Google : " I 'm ugly ? "
This is unk . unk is 13 and unk .
And as a mother , they want to be a little bit more and more .
It unk her something , you know , when you hear her mother , she told me that she 's happy to tell her every day in the school that
Because her mother will tell you , and your friends or something else , they do n't know what they believe .
Some of them are so that you should n't think about .
This is an average , healthy unk , the girl in which makes a sense of my life .
Well , the boys who are very rare .
They are under high , and online and online , they 're talking , " unk , " unk , unk , unk , says , " unk , never
Never before we were so connected , so it was so unk , so young .
A mother said to me , when it was a good party in the room .
You just have a personal life .
And the social system which is about unk .
This time -- there 's a lot of kids who are unk on the number of " unk " and the kind of the instructions that they get .
There 's no control between online and online . "
What 's real and not , is really hard to say .
What is your source ?
You can see the images in the unk of the kids today .
It 's about 50 , not just unk .
unk is unk .
And look like unk unk , unk unk , unk unk and unk .
By the unk , unk , unk unk is unk .
This is going to go to the unk and unk unk in women .
Now , culture . Let 's look at what you 're talking about .
But the boys are not too bad .
The foundation for the face of the face of the face of unk and unk unk .
But where is the problem ?
So let 's want us to our children , healthy people .
But in one of the unk culture of our culture , our children are more time and thinking about how to look at the rest of their own identity .
This is how their own culture , physical development , and the school in school , they have lost .
Six of 10 girls do n't say , because they think they 're not good enough .
And these are not electrical activities .
It 's fundamental activity in their culture as a human and as a society in society and education .
Chris percent , on a three - three - year - old , they have a conversation in the classroom . You do n't talk about it , because they
One of five percent do n't work at school when they do n't care about it .
If you do n't know , you do n't look like this , or you 're not enough , or you 're not enough enough , you 're going to
And that 's everywhere in China , United States .
And China , and in the same way , how many of you can .
In order to understand this , it 's about what you 're thinking about , and not like you 're actually .
unk . unk unk unk .
But it 's also the health health .
unk with unk unk , we do n't eat a lot of food , so we can eat a lot of insects , and they do more than the weight
And it does n't happen .
Women who think that they are unk -- and again , in the same way , whether they 're not or higher .
17 percent of the women would n't have to do a job , when they look at the day with their eyes .
Think about what it does with the economy .
If we 've got that , we have the possibilities that we need .
And this potential is , in part of every single one of us .
But how do we do that ?
Only we 're not going to talk about .
This is not alone .
If we want to move , we need to do something .
Here are three questions : First of all , we need to be self - unk .
We need to be able to try to figure out how to develop the structure of unk and the unk of unk .
The good news is that it has a lot of programs .
But the bad news is that most people do n't work .
I was shocked to tell you that good unk had the situation of unk .
We really need to believe that the programs that we do n't do is not only a positive , but also a unk effect .
The research shows that the best students are unk unk , the first thing of the human family , friends and relationships .
Secondly , the media and the unk unk , which is unk with unk and unk , like us , and we look at the other level of unk and
That 's why we 've been talking about women , and how they talk about .
It 's not okay , because we have the unk of our unk , because of the size of their lungs , or unk , success , that success is
We need to start to do their action , and not what they look like .
We can all start to make responsibility for the pictures and images that we are in social networks .
We can send people for their unk and their own , and not how they look .
And I ask you , when did you find a mirror ?
We need to find as governments and governments , and it 's going to be working on how to move to their kids , self - unk and diversity ,
We need the people who really want to move to the unk , so they do something in the world .
We need to move the stage , because it 's changed the world .
A world , in our kids who have the freedom , the best of their own self , who are in their mind , they do n't want to be
Think of what it could do for someone in your life .
A friend ? Or the woman , which is something else .
What would it mean for them when they were from this voice , their own identity ?
What would it mean for us if we had this unk and how they had the potential ?
Today , all of us is the culture of our culture .
Let 's tell our kids .
Let 's show them that look like a part of our identity , and that we actually love it for what they are , what they do , and what
unk has to follow the curriculum .
Every single one of us should be like what we 're talking about and other people .
This is where we live in a community , from the unk until the governments , so that the unk unk are from the unk unk of tomorrow .
Let 's go .
On the five , we went to the United States , there was a guy called unk unk unk in a hotel in New York and unk unk unk unk
unk was first of the unk of the unk unk , but when he wrote his head of unk , there was other people in the unk of unk ,
Fortunately , they have these plans from a FBI 's unk unk .
Unfortunately , in the unk of the World World Center , did n't have been unk .
And I was in unk , in Spain , 23 years ago , as a son was born by an American and an American doctor , and she was born
Just when I was seven years old , it began to change .
My father showed me a side of Islam , which was just a few people , including the majority of the penguins .
But there 's all in religion , in every human beings , a little bit of human people who have unk in their faith , they have to believe they
We came to the unk unk unk , which was not our knowledge from the FBI .
At the day , the last thing I was in my day , the whole little light came out of the sound , and the surprise of all of my
So this seemed seemed to tell me very much to remember , but I just got a few years later , what they were looking like this .
They thought I had the same as my father .
These guys had to come up with a unk , with a unk with a unk unk of the unk of the unk of the unk unk , and the
For men , I saw .
These men , I said , " unk , " which means " as " My " means "
When I was unk , we had been 16 years old , and I found that in my childhood , I had a chance to find friends .
When I was going to go back to a little bit of unk , it was time to get the unk , and the next city .
I 've always been part of the new part of the class , I was often the victims of unk .
So I spent most of my time home . I read reading books , and video games .
That 's why I was interested in unk skills -- it unk unk -- and I was in a unk unk , I did n't have the real world .
I was so interested in people who had to be able to measure the scale of how they were looking for their culture or their religion .
So what was the open eyes ?
And one of my first experiences that changed my thinking , I was in 2000 .
When I went to college , I was working on the National National unk in unk .
The unk of my group was unk unk , and I was almost my entire life of unk , and I was going to talk about this passion .
The members of our group came from different areas .
At the day of the day , I found that a boy who had me unk , I was unk .
It had a few days ago , to get back to the details of it , and I realized that there were two of us not natural unk .
That 's where I met people in all of the cultures and cultures , and the experience of my experience .
That feeling that I was able to make the chance to teach me when I was taught to be able to look at the real world .
I do n't know how it 's been to be gay , but I do n't know how to do it , which is what I 'm going to control
Then there was the " unk show . "
unk comes from a side of the side , and the fact that a friend of my life looked like when my father father was not to me .
One day , I had a conversation with my mother , like my view , and she told me something about it , and so I live in my life
She looked at me with the eyes of a photo woman who had a whole life experience , and she said , " I 'm sorry . "
In this moment , I was aware of how much energy energy is needed to be able to keep this kind of unk .
unk unk is not my real name .
I 've changed it , when my family had to do with my father and a new life .
So why unk me , and I 'm going to be able to believe it ?
That 's very simple .
Instead , I use my experience , to stop terrorism , against the unk .
I do it for the victims of terrorism , and the unk , in the terrible pain and the loss of violence in their lives .
For the victims of terrorism , I 'm talking about these unk of unk and the unk of my father .
With this case , I 've been able to find the fact that the violence does n't work in religion or religion , and the son 's not going to
I 'm not my father .
In this moment , there 's a film in your head .
It 's a unk , unk film .
He has 3D 3D unk for all of what you can see , but it 's just the beginning .
You 've got the smell , and smell .
He has a feeling for your body , pain , unk .
He has emotion , anger and joy .
He has memory memories , for example , when you look at the moment .
And he had a unk sentence : the unk mind .
The unk in the movie , you can do it all right .
The film is on the consciousness of consciousness , the result of what you 're thinking about your mind and the world .
The consciousness is one of the fundamental elements of human rights .
Each of us is aware .
We all have our own music , and you , and you .
There 's nothing that we 're going to do .
At least , my heart is right .
I ca n't be sure you 're aware .
Our consciousness is also what life makes life .
If we were not aware , we had nothing in our lives , or a value .
At the same time , it 's also the modern phenomenon of the universe .
Why are n't we just robots robots all of these information , and all of the capacity , without the nervous of this story ?
At that moment , nobody had the answers to these questions .
I 'm going to argue that some of the ideas have to be able to change the area of the universe of progress .
Some say , science is not impossible .
The science is from nature .
This is consciousness from nature .
And it can never make science science .
For the majority of the 20th century , this was unk .
There 's a self - unk behavior , a very interesting brain brain , and nobody has never seen consciousness .
And more than 30 years ago , when TED was published , in the area of life , there was a lot of science .
It was about 20 years ago .
Now , like John Johnson and France like unk unk , the time had to come up in the science , we 've learned about consciousness .
And in this time , there was a real change in the science of consciousness .
This work is great . It 's great .
But they also have a few other things .
A part of this work we 've just seen from unk unk , as they have a wonderful job .
Now we 're looking for much better than the brain with your perception of their faces , or with the feeling of pain or happiness .
But this is still part of science .
It 's not science science .
We know that these areas are in certain species of unk , but we do n't know why they do that .
I see this way that this kind of view of psychology and some of the minds of consciousness , we 're going to look at the answers -- the question
But in a way , this is the same problems .
Nothing of politicians .
It 's not a real problem .
But this does n't change the real puzzle , which is the core of this issue : " Why are all of the physical processes in the brain of the
Why does this exist in unk ?
So far , there 's no answer to this question .
Now you might think you should be science for a few years .
It 's going to another another phenomenon of unk , like unk , like the life , and we 'll explain it .
The real problems of each of all of the behavior of the behavior are like , like unk , like a living organism , unk , unk and unk ,
You could do this in the human brain brain , by the behavior of the human brain as a phenomenon , what we 're going to talk about how we
But if it 's about consciousness , the questions of the most important problems .
If it 's a complicated problem , it comes to the question , why all of these behavior are from an experience of experience .
There 's the unk of the unk , which is actually the unk of the science , we do n't have a lot to say .
In science , I 'm in the heart of unk .
I want to write a scientific theory of consciousness , which works for a long time , I 've been looking for a theory of consciousness , which is completely
But I had to realize that this was n't going to do it .
So I think we have a kind of unk .
We 've got this wonderful , wonderful chain on this , and it 's like most of the laws of physics , the chemistry , the chemistry of biology ,
But the consciousness does n't seem to look at this model .
On the side of this side , we were aware .
On the other side , we do n't know how to do this in our scientific view .
And so , I think that the consciousness in the moment is a kind of unk , that we have to look at our cities , but we do n't
unk with an example of a unk would have come to me , and I think we could have one or two ideas , which are crazy crazy before we
There 's a couple of questions , which are these crazy ideas in question .
My friend unk , which is here , is one of these ideas .
He means that it 's not a difficult problem with consciousness .
And the concept of the concept of physics is based on a kind of illusion or unk .
In fact , we just have to function the function of the brain , and then we all have to explain what it has to be .
I 'm just to talk about this idea !
This is the kind of ideas that we have to see when we have a unk and unk theory of consciousness .
But I think this idea for me and not many different unk , because they have the existence of human consciousness .
So I go to a different direction .
In the rest of the time , I 'd like to two things that I think that they can be .
The first idea is that consciousness is consciousness .
And some of the things of the universe are actually like unk , we have time .
They have the principles of the laws that they 're based on how the laws of gravity , or they are quantum mechanics .
And these fundamental properties and laws are nothing about unk .
They 're going to be more than unk , and they 're on the basis of the world .
Sometimes it 's going to be the list of the most fundamental things .
And in the 19th century , it turns out that the phenomenon of the language is not based on the fundamental principles of the universe , there 's time ,
I think we think we are in the same situation .
If you do n't know , in the control of the genetic elements , there is a space -- in time , there , unk , unk -- then the
The natural natural would have a sense of self - unk , to create a part of the world 's built by nature .
It does n't mean that you can not do science .
It opens the way to science science .
What we 've got to have to do is fundamental fundamental laws that are conscious of consciousness , the consciousness of self - based on the other parts of the
And sometimes , sometimes , we need to have the fundamental fundamental laws that are so simple that you can put it on the front of a T - shirt
I think we believe we are in such a situation .
We want to use the laws that are so simple that you can use it in a T - shirt .
We do n't know what the laws are , but we 're working on this .
The second idea is that the consciousness is impossible .
Every system could have a certain way of consciousness .
This is going to be unk as a unk unk , " unk " unk for all , " unk " in the spirit of the system , not only
Even every time , there was a certain amount of consciousness .
This is not saying that unk can be smart or you can .
A unk is not unk , and she says , " Oh , I 'm going to look at the speed of light .
I never can go back to me . "
No , not .
But the idea that it might have a certain kind of unk unk , a sense of the unk of consciousness .
That 's for a little bit sound .
I mean , why should someone do something like this ?
For part , it 's in the first crazy idea that 's consciousness .
If it 's limited , like space and time , there is , it means that it has to be universal as it as they are .
You also have to say that this idea that we are looking at the other people in the other cultures , but less less unk , in cultures , the
There 's a deeper part of the idea that might be the best and the best way to understand the fundamental laws of consciousness and physical function , it 's
Where 's still there , there 's consciousness .
unk information , like people -- in consciousness .
unk unk , consciousness .
unk is that in the last few years , a unk , unk unk , the approach of this theory has developed with a theory theory .
It makes a look at the bottom of the unk , which is called " unk to unk the system in a system .
And he was thinking that it 's about consciousness .
So in the human brain , it 's a huge amount of unk , a high level of high level , a lot of consciousness .
In a mouse , there 's a lot of unk , unk , still in high level level of consciousness .
But when we 're going to go back to the microbes , there are unk , it 's unk .
unk unk , but it 's more than less than zero .
unk unk theory is still going to be consciousness , that 's zero zero .
In fact , there 's a legal law of consciousness , " unk , unk .
I do n't know whether it 's a theory theory , but it could be the unk of the theory of the history of history , and they have the
Another thing that means is that we could be able to help the consciousness in the physical world .
And scientists and unk unk looked at the physics of unk .
It turns out the structure of reality is one of them , but they do n't tell us what the reality is .
Now , when I said , " What 's the unk life ? "
After the view of the unk , you can see the principles of physics , as they are , but you can use it to use the power of the
That 's what the physics is going to do the power of consciousness .
So it 's the consciousness of consciousness , which is the unk of life .
From this point , the consciousness does n't look at the physical world as a way .
It 's just in your center .
I think that this unk view has changed the potential of our relationship to nature in the change , and there might be some serious and social consequences .
Some of them are not true .
I thought I should n't eat food , and that 's why .
If you look at unk , you 're going to be hungry .
I think , if you think about it , we could change our view of what it comes from , and in fact , in fact , less than the
It 's also , of course , in consciousness , in consciousness , like , for example , in the computer .
What about the nature of the system in the film ? "
Is it aware ?
unk the unk , unk unk , you know , you have a high level of information and unk , and so the answer is , yes , she 's
If the right thing is , there are serious serious issues , both of the international development of unk as much as the international community .
And then finally , after you have to understand the culture of all groups , the planet .
Is Canada ?
Or on the local level , a unk group , like the audience at a conference conference , we 've just seen a collective TED consciousness -- there 's a
I know the answer to this question , but I think they should be asked .
Okay , this vision of unk unk , and I do n't know whether it 's right .
I 'm actually more unk from the first crazy idea that consciousness is as a result of the second that it 's universal .
Now , this view of a lot of questions in terms of a lot of hope to give us the same of the parts of the world , and this
If we can find answers to us , we are in the right way to get a good theory of consciousness .
If you 're not , it 's the most complex problem in science and philosophy .
We ca n't expect it to talk about night .
But I think we 're going to change it .
I think we can understand the consciousness of consciousness , and we need to understand the universe in the universe as we understand ourselves .
It may just be the crazy crazy idea .
Thank you .
I grew up in a very small city .
My childhood was normal and unk .
I went to school , to be friends with my friends .
It was all normal .
When I was 15 , I was talking to a community of my parents , who wanted me to be an honor for special unk .
My parents said , " Well , that 's really nice , but there 's a problem problem .
To be honest , she did n't have anything done , and they were right .
I went to school , a good press , who was working on a school in my mother , and she spent a time , " unk -- in the
Yeah , I know . What a unk .
But they were right .
Two years later , when I was in high school in a high school in school , later , after 20 years later in the unk of a kid ,
" What ? " I wanted to know .
I had 20 minutes of unk and unk unk .
He said , " You know , you know , your unk .
If someone in the house , he gave this guy in unk .
It 's not usually in the unk . "
And there was a light light on me -- this boy had a lot of people in the history of unk .
For for it , we can do it -- and I ca n't do anything about it .
For many , there are no teachers , doctors or doctors .
We are not real people . We should be .
And in fact , I 'm sitting here on this stage , and I look like this in a wheelchair , and you probably think of that , I think
Ladies and gentlemen , I have to lose it .
I 'm not here to show you .
I 'm going to tell you that we were going to be unk .
It 's not bad , and she does n't make us .
In the last few years , we could send this message in the social media , even more .
You probably saw pictures like this : " The only way in life is a bad experience . "
Or , " You can be unk . "
Or , " Oh , you know , unk ! "
These are just a few examples . There are many of these images .
You know the one of the little girls in the hands with the paper in your mouth .
You might have the kid , which is unk in the unk .
And these images , there are many people we call it unk .
I use the word " unk , " because you 're going to make people in order to do it .
You 're able to create objects , to be able to benefit .
These images have come to , to be able to come to , because they 're looking at the unk , and you know , " How much my life
I could have this man . "
But what if you have this human being ?
I went down to tell me how many people told me to tell me that they were told me , or thank you .
And in a way , you know , I 'd like to go to the morning , and I 'd like to tell you my name . This is a
All these images are made in objects , for the good unk .
unk are there to be able to look at how they feel better , and he 's worried .
The life with it is really hard .
We do so many things .
But what we do is not that what you think .
It has nothing to do with our body .
I mean , I mean , with unk with the concept of unk , because I 'm the social model of language , and we are more interested in society
I 've been living for a long time in this body .
I like him .
He does what to do , and I 've learned to understand his ability to use the same as you . That 's what they 're talking about the kids
They do n't exist .
They use their body , so it 's possible .
Is it really fair , like they made objects and how to show these pictures ?
If people say , " You 're an artist , " they want to do . "
I know why .
Because the one who comes to us is that it 's an extraordinary experience .
I just unk myself from inspiration , and you think , " Man , unk , you 've never made something ? "
But , yeah .
I 'm learning from other people .
But I do n't learn because I was more lucky than they were .
I learn that a great idea is , with a unk unk , I 've learned the trick , the unk , the phone is the battery on the battery
unk !
We learn from the unk and the unk of the other 's not in the fight against our bodies , and it 's a world that makes us to be
I think it 's about the unk of unk unk .
It makes us hard life .
And the quote , " The only unk in life is a bad unk , " because it 's not true because of the social model .
You can get the back to a long time , and it 's not going to be able to grow up .
It never will happen .
I want to live in a world where it 's the culture .
In one of the girls in the house of the house -- in the unk of the unk , it does n't look like unk , it 's just because
I want to live in a world where you do n't like to go from a little bit of unk , and remember the unk of the morning .
I want to live in a world live in the actual actual unk unk ; I want to live in a world where a student in the school has been
It 's not really extraordinary to us , but it 's the unk of our behavior .
Thank you .
What ? " unk reality reality , " unk and unk ?
How fast is a unk ? "
Unfortunately , I 'm going to tell you about one of these questions that you 're not going to be disappointed .
Most people think in reality reality is called " unk " and unk , " he was in the air unk , but unk is not science fiction .
unk is something that will be faster than we think we are in our lifetime , and we 're going to be able to change the technologies , and you
And how do we get the unk ?
The first step for me . I 'm just Google Google .
For many of you , you know , you know , you know , you know , on television .
You do n't know that Google Google a device is to show you what I see .
And as you know , it 's like unk in the field .
At the moment , you can just experience that when I show you .
I have to argue in words .
I have to create a change that you can do with your imagination .
In Google Google , we can get a cup of a bread , and a sense of what it 's like to move around with things that 's going to
You can experience how it 's when a unk man on unk and unk , trying to try to unk .
I have this experience , and it does n't feel good .
Here 's the video .
Go .
unk , unk , is unk .
Now , let me go closer .
Are you ready ?
Go !
They 've found that there are people who are missing the rest of the team .
We have a video from the college of Washington .
unk : unk , unk unk ! unk !
unk : unk !
Oh !
unk want this experience .
You want to go to the field .
You want to be your unk , and she said to me about YouTube and Twitter , said , " Can you make a unk ? "
As soon as we experience , like unk and Google , how do we do better ?
What 's the next step ?
The unk Valley is one of the unk unk of all the time , and that 's not just a unk .
And I can show you this video show why this is so .
Oh ! !
No ! No ! No ! I do n't want ! No !
Oh my God ! unk !
This is a man and a unk and unk to life .
How is it going to be for him when he was going to go to the next to a hundred miles an hour ?
I think I 'm going to be unk .
But this is not a unk .
That 's just virtual reality .
How do we get to unk ?
And we do this , when a unk , and you have this information , and you ask , " How do we improve our team ?
How do we use these games ? "
We use these technologies to play games .
You would like to get money .
A short story of the technology .
In fact , the unk of unk unk unk had a unk unk , which he would have been able to make a faster faster .
They won the unk .
Some of them were unk .
More people looked like the games games .
It was exciting and faster .
In unk , the unk of unk unk unk unk unk unk , later .
More people looked to play games .
unk .
Imagine that , you 're playing with you , you 're going to go back to the unk , and you look at the next level of unk on your
No fear of unk unk .
No fear , all of course can learn to learn .
They go there , and they react .
And the one who wants to do that , because they do n't follow the games , and do n't lose .
Then they 're going to be unk .
They do n't want .
But unk is not just a unk unk .
unk allows you to all of these data in real time , and you can play the game .
How would you see ?
A very simple light could be a camera in every corner of the unk , all the way down from the front of the face .
They also have the data from the unk and the unk technology , which has been working on .
They all of these data for your sisters .
The best team had unk data .
The bad water is a unk .
The same is good and bad .
And now , you 're not just about all of your unk , and it 's not just about unk .
It was also unk . Who would have thought ?
How would you see this ?
Imagine you 're unk .
They get the ball .
They 're looking for free .
Suddenly , on the left left , there was a window down to your unk and show you that the word " unk " unk "
In fact , you do n't see it , but the unk is the one that 's just two .
They go to the position .
Another thing for a unk .
They fall , but they 're going to meet .
The ball is not .
You do n't know where it goes down .
But on the unk of the unk , the unk is and he can react .
He can get the ball , it goes down .
The amount of unk , and the unk are at some time , and everybody in your perspective .
This will be a new part of the game .
People are going to be in unk , because they want this experience .
unk want to be in the field .
Do you want to be unk .
unk is part of the unk , because it does n't do it .
But my question question is : Are we going to be unk with it ?
Do we just use a bread for bread and games , normal normal ?
I think that we can use more for more .
I think we can use the unk to use the empathy in human beings , as we can tell you how it 's in someone else .
We know what technology technology is worth .
They spend every year in unk .
What is this technology on a unk in Uganda or Russia , which is the world wants to look at what conditions are ?
What is this technology ? unk unk unk unk or unk unk , which is a generation of children who want to tell about the space and science and not
Ladies and gentlemen , the unk will become reality .
The questions that we ask , the decisions that we meet , the challenges that we are , is , as we 're all in our hand .
Thank you .
I 'm recently , 23 years ago , it was in the unk of unk .
Most of the time in this 23 years , when I went to the unk of the streets of the unk , he was in the unk of the unk
The bridge is a unk unk unk , the world for his beautiful look at San Francisco , the Pacific Ocean and his architecture architecture .
Unfortunately , it 's also a unk for a year , because they heard the world in most of these places .
The unk War was opened .
I said , " unk , the unk unk , which is about the words : " The bridge is unk .
unk on the bridge is not force , it 's not practical . "
But in their course , there was more than a thousand people from this bridge in the death .
Some people believe that there 's a light between the two unk in a different dimension -- the bridge is so unk -- that you know about the case of
I 'm going to tell you what 's actually happening when the bridge is to be used for a war .
In the unk , the bones of some of the organs organs .
Most of them die .
Those who are not going to die at all the water in the water , and it 's all .
I do n't think that the person in this kind of unk , I think , is one of the death death death .
This is the unk .
Anyway , from the area of the two , they 're going to have two meters of the four feet of the bridge .
Here 's the most people you before .
From my experience , you can say that a person who has been on the wall , and it 's a very long time .
I took this photo last year , when this young woman had a unk and talk about life .
I 'm very happy to tell you that we had to go back to this day , they were on the other side of the side .
When I started working on the bridge , there was no training training .
You 've got to go through the phone .
That was not just a unk for potential cancer , but it was not the police .
We 've got a long way to get behind .
Today , unk unk , and the new unk .
This is unk unk .
I 've been 25 years ago at the end of June , it said , " I 'm going to call a call of unk in the middle of the
And I said , and when I came up , I looked at how he went to the unk of the unk of unk unk .
Abed was only three years old years ago , in New York .
After we had an hour to talk about , he asked us whether we had the story of the day .
Now we remember the unk of unk unk unk , and we looked at the planet , and we told her , " never never unk this . "
And one day , after a day , when they came back , she opened the unk .
unk came up , suffering , and all the species of people who were talking about the world .
The only thing in the unk was the hope .
And then I said , " What happens when you 're going to go back to the edge , and not hope ? "
He was for a long time , he went to the right and left .
This is a very nice man in New York .
I 've been talking to the day with unk unk , and I think when I talked to them , I was not very good at all the day ,
unk parents had asked him .
The unk of a unk system is so many people from .
I 'm going to ask you the question questions : What would you do when a family was a friend or a friend 's dead ?
What would you say ?
Would you know what to say ?
In my experience , it 's not just about the cooperation , but it 's listening .
Listen to understand .
Do n't you do n't , you do n't say , or you do n't tell you the other person you do n't know how to feel it , because
If you just only be there , you might think the point of the person .
If you think there is someone said , " You 're not afraid of that person with that .
You could ask a question question : " other people in mind have to think about her life , have you thought about that ? "
The person in the room is to save your lives , and perhaps the lives for them .
Some of the signs that you 're talking about : " unk , who believe that the things are wrong and never better ; it 's the belief that you
I 've got this talk about a few days a few days ago , and I have a email email from one of the lady that I 'd like to
She had her son at the 19th century , this year , and she wrote me this email , just a few days before , and their students , and
" Hi , thank you , you 're just at the TED conference .
That has a great experience .
I think I would have to go to the weekend on the bridge .
I wanted to show you a few lines .
And I hope that you can get a lot of people in your message , and they go home and talk to your friends , you know , and they
I 'm still quite unk , but I still have more moments moments that I 'm going to realize that is not happy to come home .
unk is from unk San Francisco to go back to the 19th century , with his father 's thinking about the game .
It 's never been there .
I have the police police in unk , and he was going to do that in the night .
The next morning came up to me , to go home , and I 'd like to drive the car car on the bridge .
A unk looked like he said to the day before the week .
Thank you very much for you to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be more powerful .
Who did n't even feel bad if he had a mental illness ?
It should n't be so easy to make your life .
I pray for you and you fight the fight .
The unk , unk , unk is a plan of our beautiful , and not a unk .
Fortunately , this week , unk unk . "
I ca n't imagine how much of it has to be able to go to the bridge , and the way to go to the city of this day ,
I want to tell you a man who 's hope for me and hope .
At 9/11 , I was able to go to a unk about a hundred people in unk .
I went to my unk unk , and I saw this young man , unk unk , as he was on the unk .
For the next year and a few hours I heard , as he heard about his wife and his unk .
unk decided to go back to the day of their own time and his life has another chance .
When unk unk , I unk him .
" This is a new beginning , a new life . "
But I asked him , " What 's exactly what you 've got to do this ? "
And you know what he told me ?
He said , " You got me .
You have to talk to me , and you 've just heard it . "
In short of this year , I wrote a letter from a mother and I was going to put it with this , and I would like to tell you
" Oh , Mr. unk , nothing ca n't happen from the ' 70s , " but they 're just one of the reasons why many of us have been
And I believe it has been able to show up .
He was born in a unique disease , which he had the unk of medicine .
So , I 've been able to show you a six months ago , in front of the three - dimensional properties , but God thank you very well .
unk is okay , as he says .
We thank God for you .
unk in your unk , unk unk unk . "
And at the end of it , she says , " When I was at the hospital of San Francisco , this morning , she was a patient .
Boy : I had to do it again . "
Today , there 's a colleague of father and a unk member of society .
He 's talking about the history of the day , and his depression in the hope that his story has been inspired .
unk is not just in my job .
And in the personal environment .
My grandfather has lost in life .
This is actually what he had to do with his own pain , and I had the opportunity to understand it .
This is a unk .
Most of the people , or the ones that they would have to think about the other people .
They just want to be their own memory .
This is happening in a three - three - year - old , sleep , or unk , or death .
In my career , I 've been hundreds of hundreds of three months ago , and we had hundreds of mental diseases , and then we went around the bridge
In the unk , where I was interested in , I was only two people lost , but it 's two .
One of them was born .
The other was a man who was talking about an hour .
It has three times my hand .
And last last year , he looked at me , and he said , " Yes , I 'm sorry , but I have to go . "
And he moved .
I want to tell you that most of the people that we 're looking at the bridge is not peace .
And also , most of the people who had the people , and they have to talk about it , or two percent of these people who said they were
I 'm going to tell you that the bridge is not just unk and San Francisco , but it 's also unk .
The connection , or the bridge that we do is something that every single one of us should be .
unk is unk .
There are help . There 's hope .
Thank you .
The world makes me something you do n't know , but you 're in your life , you know what you are , and the question you are in your
I 'm going to be something special , but I 'm not alone , not just alone .
When I was a model , it was like that was the dream that I had been in my life , finally .
My unk self was in my mind , my inner self self .
The reason for me is -- -- I 'm going to go back to this story , like , " unk , " unk , that 's what you 've
But last year , I realized I was at the beginning .
We 're all going to be in unk , from our families , from our religion , from our society , from the time we live in our own bodies
Some people have become the courage to be free , who do n't accept the unk of their skin , or the belief of their friends .
These people are still a threat for the status of the status , which is as likely to be .
In my case , when the last nine years ago , my friends , some of my friends , even my personal story about my story .
When I was five years old , I was home at the back of the United States in my head .
My mother had asked me , " Why do you always take this T - shirt in your head ? "
I said , " unk , this is my hair . I 'm a girl . "
I knew my own identity .
unk has always been in the face of unk , but we know that it 's complex , and it 's too complex .
Because of my career , I never had the courage to tell my story , not because I thought that I was not true , but in the way ,
Every day I 'm so grateful because I 'm a woman .
I have a mother , a father and a family who was like me , like me .
Many do n't have so much .
In Asia , there are an old tradition , the sex than a unk .
There 's an unk of compassion .
There 's a culture of unk , a unk unk .
When I was eight years old , I was working on a unk on the unk of the unk .
I was at the stage of the stage , and I know there was this beautiful woman , right before I thought about , and I had this kind of
When I was 15 years old , it was always a boy , I met a woman called unk .
She was unk for unk unk .
At this night , she asked me , " Why do n't you do it ? "
This moment changed my life .
Suddenly , I found myself in the world .
Not many people were in the first job of unk in unk for women -- but I feel .
And in the age between five and 17 years ago , I was working on the unk , and with these things like the police in the house , or
I also also had the unk of strangers , especially in unk in the Gulf of sculpture .
But most importantly , I had some of my best friends in this community .
In the year , I was called my mother from San Francisco , and I said that my name was a green unk , I was in the United States
I went to him .
I said , " unk , I said .
I 'm here with friends , I love to travel and travel .
Two weeks later , she went back to me , and she said , " You know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
More I had to hear .
My mother said , " I should have to name my name with two email . "
She was also me when I was in 19 years ago .
It 's interesting to be in the unk areas of unk , and they have unk surgery .
At the time , there was to be able to change your name and his sex .
So , I went back to San Francisco , and I do n't know when I 'm going to move my unk unk with the name of unk and unk
That was a unk moment .
For a couple of people here , this is a piece of a plan for the car , or to buy , of course , but for me , my
I believe I had to be able to live in New York City .
Many do n't have so much .
I think there 's a woman called unk unk .
It 's from New York , a young woman who had her face , but they had their lives .
For most of my time , this is the reality we live in .
Our unk is now in the size of the public population .
Every year of 20 years ago , we have a global unk for the day day .
I 'm here on this stage , because there 's a long story of human beings , and the unk of violence and corruption .
These are unk Johnson and unk unk .
Today , in this moment , my story is unk .
I could n't live my longer for me .
I want to do my own , to help others , to be aware of shame and shame .
I 'm going to be unk here , and I do n't want to be able to be able to do it , 20 years ago , we have a
My name was allowed me to me , like this , as I am .
Can you do that ?
Thank you .
I 'd like to tell you what to tell you , especially parents , but in the other sense of other friends , and families , all the kids who
Sure . unk : I was very good .
And sometimes it does n't sometimes sometimes -- so -- it 's just the way that the identity identity is in its heart 's self - unk .
We 're all going to be born with a culture , and we 're trying to get a conversation about the culture of unk , and not just to be
The unk movement is very interesting at the beginning of unk and unk .
There are still a lot to do .
It should be a clue .
It was supposed to be able to tell me , to ask questions , and I hope you all of these are my colleagues .
Thank you . That was beautiful . Thank you .
So in many societies societies and societies , they are mostly unk by their sons , but I 'm just a few of the parents who had been through his
And she was my daughter , but I 'm her father .
Ladies , ladies and gentlemen , when we look at the history of humanity , the story of women is a story of violence , between violence and violence .
It 's not going to be , and she 's not her mother 's mother .
The neighborhood is coming back to the mother , and no unk father .
A mother is very uncomfortable when they get a girl .
If it 's the first girl in the world , the first daughter , she 's sad .
If you take the second one to the world , she 's shocked to me , and in a son , a son , the son 's coming from the
Not only the mother , but it 's the daughter , the daughter 's daughter , when this is older , it 's suffering .
With five , in a age , when she was going to go to school , she went home to their mother in their sisters .
By the age of 12 years , they have a good life .
It can be fun .
You can see with their friends on the street , and they can make it more like a unk .
But as a kid , with 13 years later , she would not be unk with the male house from the house .
It 's in the middle of the walls in their walls .
It 's not longer than a man .
It 's going to be the president of their father 's mother , and his friends , and when she called the unk , she can be killed .
Now , what 's also interesting is that this is not called the unk of the other day , but also the lives of the male family .
I know a family with seven and sisters and a brother , and one of his brother in the unk unk , who had a living for his sister and
So , his brother , unk , and the joy in his life and the happiness of his sisters on the unk of the Bush .
There 's another more important part of the cultural societies and this is unk .
A good job is very very , very , very dangerous and very unk .
That 's the unk .
The good news is very quiet .
It should be very unk , and they should have the choice of their mother and their mother , and the decisions of the older people , if they were
It 's going to be called unk .
And what happens ?
In the words of a unk , she 's going to be married and unk to send the sisters and three to the world .
And this cycle is still moving .
Very , ladies and gentlemen , these unk million people have changed , when we look differently , when women and men are different , when men and women in
Love and sisters , when I was born born , when I was the first time -- and I believe I believe , I said , " I 'm not
A few years ago , I was thinking about her name , and I was fascinated by the unk , unk unk from Afghanistan .
Her name was unk of unk and I was my daughter .
Some days after unk , after the birth of my daughter , my son came from -- and he had been lost -- he came to me home , and
And when I looked like him -- all of these men were -- I took my paper , and I got a line from my name , and " unk
When she was older , four years ago , I spent them in school .
Now you ask me why should I say that a girl in school school ?
Yeah , I have to say it .
That might be true in Canada , in the United States and many other countries , but in poor countries , in societies societies , in societies , it 's
At school , they 're looking for their identity and their name .
It 's going to go to school , that they are in the world of their dreams and their hope where they can use their bodies for their lives for
I have five sisters and no one could have been able to go to school , and I 'm going to do it , but two weeks ago when I
And the reason for me was that I never had the name of my sisters on a couple of interesting .
What my father could n't have had to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to change
I 've lost the intelligence and the unk of my daughter .
I 've been able to do it with me when my friends came to me .
I 've been able to do it with me to show a few online .
And all of these things I was trying to do in my personality .
And that was not only for them , not just for unk .
I 've been able to have the same values in my school , and they did n't work with students .
I was education for education .
I brought my girls , and I got my unk in the lesson of unk .
I brought my students at the lesson of the event called unk .
His brothers and sisters , we were both more bad for women , and we decided to get more and more more and more than women in society .
But we 're on a new phenomenon .
Something unk of human rights , especially in men and men .
It 's called unk .
This is the whole of the unk of women in all political , economic and social activity .
hundreds of schools have lost .
Girl was used to go to school .
Women were forced to be unk , and they got to go to markets .
unk were in silence , and girls were killed .
Two of them , but they were just a little bit about the things , and it 's very unk , for their own rights , when you 're talking
It 's really the unk thing .
In the age of 10 years ago , he was on unk , and she was right for education .
She wrote a website for a unk blog , she was working on the New York Times , and she talked to all of you .
And their voice was the voice voice .
It 's like " unk " everywhere in the world .
And that was the reason why the Taliban did n't have been able to go to the nine year . And then finally , after she came out of a
It was the day of the unk for my family and me .
The world was a big black hole .
While my daughter and death unk , I 'm going to read to the woman , " I 'm going to tell her what my daughter and her daughter is
And they were immediately unk , " Please do n't you win .
You 're right for the right thing .
You have your life on the game for the truth of the peace , and the education , and your daughter came from me and follow .
You 're both on the right place , and God will protect them . "
These few words were very much for me and I asked this question .
While unk was in the hospital , and he was unk , suffering , because he had unk unk , unk , I looked like a dark foot on the
But my daughter was never .
She always said to me , " My unk smile is okay , and my unk in the face .
It 's going to be good . Let me do not . "
She was a unk for us , and we were unk .
His brothers and sisters , we learned from her in the past moments , and I 'm happy to share with you , you know , and they 're a
She 's not when they do n't really open .
She 's unk with her friends , which I 'm happy .
People ask me what the other things were like to me , as he said , " unk unk , and so unk , so unk and unk .
And I 'll tell you what I 've done .
unk , I did n't do .
I do n't have their wings . It 's all .
Thank you very much .
18 years ago , I was born in the brain memory , because there was a passion for me .
I 'm actually unk .
Anyway , after a unk unk , a stick of food .
Am I 'm not intelligent or not ?
And if I ca n't get it ?
unk for my surgery , I had to do something like a lot of each of all over a few years ago , I would have nothing to be ,
Some times it was pretty much .
But luckily , I also had been able to do with this , and so I decided to try to experiment , to try to unk unk , because it
I tried to unk different unk , and I was absolutely absolutely able to change the same changes of my unk , my sense of my self - unk ,
A special case , a few years ago , I was actually unk and chemicals , which was just a man in the early ' 80s , and I could
I was very extreme .
But I realized that I was not trying to be shocked .
I was actually , a little bit of unk , and the problem with me , and it did n't just like that .
But I think I believe that this is a better understanding of men and for what they have to come from , and then I 've been much better with
I wanted to do one with the unk of this system , and so on , after , after my life , and I wanted to understand my intelligence ,
I 'm mostly in pictures of images , and so for me to do this -- as I come from these images , I have like a kind of unk
These things are not new .
unk like unk , unk and unk saw it .
They thought that images and ideas were actually the same .
Today , it 's going to be a lot of a lot of unk , and what we 're really going to do with this , but I 'm just
So , after a few years ago , I decided to go and finally , and I see a lot of very , very high - dimensional images with high
Now I 'm working on how I read these images from my head faster in my computer .
Imagine that , if you had to be able to do with the imagination of the human being in the world .
Or a kid could be able to music music .
This is an incredible way of compassion as creative people in the speed of light .
So I 'm going to show you why I think that we 're close to you , there are two years ago , we have two experiments of two groups
Both of these cameras have unk -- unk unk -- the brain , and you can see a brain model of unk and unk in his colleagues .
The left on the left is the brain person , a picture .
The blue line shows a single person in the same person who just looked at the picture .
And the right was in the face of the unk of the middle of the middle of the left and show that the difference is almost zero .
This has been in many different people , and lots of different pictures , and with a similar event .
There are so good as a difference between the actual image of the picture , and the unk , the same image .
So let me show you a few weeks ago , which of Jack unk in the University of unk .
In this experiment , there were hundreds of hundreds of thousands of thousands of videos , while they were built by their brains , and so it has a huge
And then there was a new film , a few months ago , new images , new people , new animals , and there was a new unk .
The computer , just by the unk unk unk , the unk , and the other thing he thought he was able to see .
On the right side you can see the experiment and the left on the left side of the unk .
There 's a language language .
We are so close .
We need to be able to get the heart .
And you do n't know if you look at a picture , and if you look at the same picture , it 's almost exactly the same time .
So this is where we had been at the top of the middle of high school today , and we have the resolution of all the time in the past
Now , where we need to get the first time , we 're also going to make a long time to get into imagination .
How do we do that ?
There are many different ways for this approach .
One way would be the skull , and his brain was electrodes .
That 's nothing for me .
It 's going to be a new lot of unk unk , some of them , but I 've been able to follow the first question that we have to
unk experiences from the heart of the same is to be able to be able to be able to cut down , but it 's going to be able to
I 'm going to look at that , rather than we have , we have a sound .
We can create very much more complex structures to do something different , just like a unk .
So why is that important ?
In the past years , it was in the genome of technology , of course , unk , unk , had to make a huge unk .
But most of the most exciting progress in the 19th actually came from the unk and unk unk in unk radio unk and unk unk .
So we should also have a magnetic field of unk patterns , rather than unk unk , unk the unk radio unk .
That 's why we can argue with this combination of the pattern pattern with unk unk , much more information from a single genome .
When we use the heart of us , we ca n't be able to use the flow of blood , but we also have unk and unk , as we
We will be able to change our ideas on the digital media .
Can you imagine a language language , and look at a human language ?
What would we have to do ?
And how are we going to learn with the laws of human beings ?
They think the Internet is big .
These are very big questions .
It could be able to use our instrument , our thinking and our unk .
And this instrument could be able to cure for Alzheimer 's disease and disease .
We have almost no other choice , like this door .
It 's hard to realize that it gets more longer .
We need to learn this step together .
Thank you .
I think we all have all of us .
You can be able to be able to tell someone to tell you that you can love , or someone to tell you that you 're pregnant , or someone
This is the unk of the conversation that is always hard , and although the most important things can be able to be the experience of a secret , and
It 's scary , and we hate it . It has to be done .
A few years ago , I worked in unk unk in the South village , a unk in the city , and while my time , I went through unk
And of course , like " unk " unk unk , and when I was just heard about the question of unk , all of a little kid said ,
And then there was a table of silence .
I unk my teeth down a little bit of unk , and I would have a little bit more about unk .
The father was unk around , and the mother , her mother had a baby .
But I said nothing , and I was not listening .
So I went to myself , that I would like to think about the next time .
I would have to get this very hard conversation .
After a few weeks ago , it happened .
" Are you a boy or a girl ? "
I have my unk unk unk .
I 've got a little bit of unk , " unk unk . "
So I 'm working in deep , and I 'm looking at a unk girl in a unk of unk , I do n't want to give a challenge ,
So I 'm going to slow down , I 'm going to look at it next to you , and I say , " Hey , I know it 's
My hair are just like a couple of boys , and I 'm unk , but I 'm a girl , and you know , as you 're like a
So , I 'm more part of the unk unk . "
And this kid look at me in the eyes , without unk , and says , " My unk is unk with fish .
Can I ask a unk ? "
How would it be a unk ? "
This was the unk , I had ever done .
And why ? Because the unk girls , and I was honest .
How many of us had some of my friends in my life , and they said , " I 've been unk . "
But you do n't look at what they 're looking at around .
You just know how to feel it was a secret .
My name is not from your or your or your story .
Of course , I 'm going to be able to give you a few examples of why my unk was more than her , but actually , it 's not
unk is hard .
Who says that it 's harder to be someone to tell you how to tell you how to tell someone that you 're talking about it ?
Who says that his unk unk unk is a while , if you 're going to teach your kid , you 're going to be a unk ?
There 's no harder , it 's just hard .
We need to stop our own problems with the other to the other way we can do with our better than bad or worse , and we should be compassion
And in a certain part of our lives , we all have to tell all of us , and we want to be security , or even more than what
But I 'm here to tell you that one of them , which is , of course , what 's the secret you 're not to do with it .
I was a unk , a unk and unk .
I was not the unk of unk , which was willing to talk about four - year - old , who were going to get into the book .
I was in fear of unk , unk unk in the corner , with my dark secret and unk , my family , and I grew up to the muscle
My family , my friends , was unk -- I had my entire life , trying to try and not people , and I asked the world on the head
I went on the sides of the unk , which we all had to do for all the long time , but when they do n't do that , they
One of my unk unk was in my brother sister .
And after a little bit of unk , he said , " I love unk ! "
And it started to fight up with unk .
" unk , was you ever in the unk ? "
" Well , we actually have friends in San Francisco . "
" We were never there , but we heard that it should be unk -- unk . "
" unk , you know ?
It 's really good , and he never got a friend . "
" unk , what would you tell you most ?
What 's our favorites ? We want to talk about .
And you know what we love ?
unk is our favorite . "
And then a woman , unk , but he was trying to give me to support their support , and to tell me that she was on my side ,
I could go to my friend and my unk table , and I 've heard about their response to their unk and their unk , who had the political political
Of course , it would be easier to do with their fingers in their unk .
It 's a lot more difficult to come to the place where they are in the place , and they have the fact that they 've been trying to do
And what can you give someone to someone else ?
If you start to get someone to be honest , you must be willing to get back to me .
unk are still not my strength .
Do you ask me what I 've ever met .
But I 'm going to be better , and I call myself how I call it the three - three - dimensional principles .
Look at these unk unk , but with the knowledge that it 's always difficult to be secret .
Number one : Be unk .
Take the unk . unk . Be unk .
The kid in the house was not a unk , but I was unk .
If you want someone to be honest , you know , you 've never heard .
Number two : unk , right hand . Do you just take it down .
If you know , you 're unk , you say it .
If you 're going to tell your parents , you 're going to be the hope that will change .
Do n't give you a little bit of unk .
They talk about your own .
Sorry .
And in this way , there were some people who would probably hurt , you know , what you 've done , but you do n't think of what you
And yeah , some of them might be very serious , but it 's not the problem of your own .
These are their expectations from who you are not .
This is not your story .
The only story that is important is what you 're saying .
So if you look at the next time you get your secret , and you look at the unk , you think that we all know how it 's like
They 're very , not alone . They 're not .
We know that it 's hard to do , but you have to open it , do n't matter what your secret is . I 'm going to thank you
intelligence : What is this ?
If we look at how intelligence , it was unk , it was the famous quote from unk unk , a question : " The question , if a machine
When unk unk wrote this , he wanted to see the early unk of the computer , unk , as an example of unk .
But if we look back to us , thinking about what 's interesting about what we 've been able to do with the unk , and machines like unk ,
That 's why I had a few years ago to try to change the fundamental understanding of the ability to understand the ability .
Let 's go back .
And start with a thought experiment .
So let 's imagine what we 've been looking for today , which is nothing about biology or biology , but you know , have developed , we have a
Here we see a very strange way .
Because the Earth would come from thousands of years ago , from Mars to come to a point , and that point on the point , over the year 2000
When we know , we actually have the actual reason that we can save ourselves .
We 're trying to make a change .
But if you have a place that would n't know , all of the things you know , you have no idea of intelligence intelligence , you would have a
I 'm saying that the same question is like the question of the nature of nature .
That 's why I found myself in a few years ago , I had a few years ago , a few years ago , looking in many different science ,
So , with the knowledge of knowledge , all of these different things I 've been asked about a few years ago , whether there 's an intelligence on the
Is there a single equation of intelligence ?
And the answer to me is , I think , " unk , " unk unk unk unk , you probably see the best way you can call " unk
What you see here is a statement that is an intelligence that has a power that is so that the future future is unk .
It 's so that the future unk will be unk , or unk , in terms of a structure , with the genetic potential unk , unk to a new
In short , said , " It 's not a unk .
intelligence is trying to be able to move to the future , and choices to open .
Well , with this equation , it can be , of course , what can we do ?
What can they predict ?
unk them ?
Do they have artificial intelligence ?
Now , I 'm going to show you a video show that I think I can find some of the amazing applications of this equation .
But what if there 's a unk connection between unk and intelligence ?
What if you ca n't be able to be able to do with the production rate , but actually , in fact , what 's happening ?
In order to find this , we have a piece of unk , which is part of a unk , " unk developed , to create the production of the
In unk , a lot of unk unk have been used to be online games , and they would spend money with unk , each other choice .
Here are some examples of unk in action .
So , as a man , without unk , without unk , we see unk , like a unk , on a car car .
This behavior is remarkable because we never had a goal .
It 's just about yourself , decided to keep the balance .
And the ability to do it , is to use for unk and unk .
So , like some of the animals in their environment , as you can use , you can see in the unk spaces , we see here that unk has
The ability to find this is in unk and agriculture .
And also , in fact , like animals , if they 're both at the same time , one of the unk , they 're looking at food , we
This is interesting interesting unk for unk and many different areas .
unk can be a range of many areas .
Here we see it in a national unk game to play themselves what they have in the game .
Here we are looking at how they create new connections in social networks , where friends are going to lose people , and they get the network .
The same capacity of medicine is also using medical health care , intelligence and intelligence .
Here we are looking like , as they have a unk unk , which has been discovered , and they used to use the amount of the rivers in the
From the same reason , there are unk unk problems in unk , unk and unk .
By the way we see here , like unk , it 's going to be used to buy unk , in unk , a unk unk , and it 's
This ability to unk is unk in social and unk .
unk unk unk : We 've just seen that there are a variety of thousands of different behavior , like unk unk , unk and unk , all of the
This leads to a deep deep .
When we go back to the use of the word " unk , " The game said , " Well , there was always the concept that if we were
The machines would be against us .
It 's a very important part of this work that we might have been thinking about the decades of unk unk .
unk are not going to be very intelligent and then unk , and try to change the world .
Another thing is unk .
I 'm going to ask like , " What 's the ability to have goals ? "
And finally , Richard , Richard Valley , even though , when he had the civilization civilization , and only one of our words could be able to change the
My third of this statement , to make a sense , to create the intelligence of intelligence , or to help them , human intelligence intelligence , this is the
Thank you .
We 're starting to have a historical moment of unk -- between the unk of the stars and the existence of our planet .
And in the last year , we have our understanding in the universe in the universe .
The third mission of NASA has found hundreds of thousands of planets on the other planet . The Earth is just one billion of our stars in our galaxy .
unk is a telescope . It 's like the light from stars on the planet , and it 's going to be unk .
The map of data shows us the size of the planet and their distance .
So we can find whether these planets are and unk , like the planet in our solar system , and also how much light light from their sun .
And this is what we 've got to find that if this is not natural or not .
But while we were in these societies , we could be unique worlds , we have our own planet in the planet of humanity .
unk was the unk year in the beginning .
Hundreds of the ice and ice reefs are within decades .
This global change in the environment we have , we 've got more and control of our control .
But I 'm not a unk . I 'm unk .
I study the unk unk on the planet , in hope , in the universe , in the universe , we could change new lives .
You could say , I 'm looking for unk space .
As a student who lived in life in the universe , I can tell you the more you than the Earth , the more you can think of your own
Each of these new worlds are allowed us to look at a different between the planet and the ones that we are at the best of the world , our
Let 's think about Mars .
The Mars is too small and unk . He 's going to go back to the sun , but unk , as if he was in a symbol of the
The Mars was able to be seen in the case , which is one of the reasons why we looked like this .
Our three , like " unk " unk " and look at the surface of life .
unk , like the unk unk mission , to take some of the structure that we have to understand how to Mars Mars .
unk companies are not just unk in the unk room , but also the potential ability to Mars Mars .
But despite these pictures of the surface of the oceans in our face , you know , we 're going to be able to find these new discoveries and new
Think about how our own bodies are dead , places that they have Mars with Mars and life .
And at the time , the unk unk , unk places in the planet , the air was full of oxygen , which we had to grow back to our
I 'm afraid that the unk on the other side of a planet , a little dark , a few people who believe that Mars has been to save us
That 's very much the way to look at the other planet , I 'm so much of this idea .
There 's a lot of good reasons to Mars Mars , but who has come to Mars , our future B B is like the unk of the unk ,
Thank you .
But the new fields of the planet and the resources is not an unk .
These are in both sides of the same side of life -- to understand , and to change the future .
places with extreme environments in our planet are different worlds .
They 're just closer to our home .
If we understand how we unk unk unk , on the Earth in the unk , we can be able to be able to be able to change our own
And finally , again , a little thought , that was a unk .
And the scientists came up once once said , because we do n't have a sign of history , where our universe is as old , and so many of
Where is this one of this life ?
A big solution to the unk unk unk is that the societies that are so far that they are lives on the planet in different ways in terms of how
It 's unk to believe that the other species on us would save ourselves , but we have the planet on the planet , and we can see the other
If we really believe in the ability to believe in the future , for Mars , we should be able to be able to change the Earth .
Thank you .
A few years ago , I broke my house .
I was home on home , and it was about unk , in the middle of the winter winter , I had my friend friends on the other side of
When I was on the unk , and I was in my unk unk , I realized that my key was .
I could use it through the window , they were there on the table , where I left behind .
I went to the house , and all of the streets and the streets , and we had the window .
I started a unk , unk , I had my phone , but it was going to be able to go back to a unk , and it was cold
I could n't have my friend friend unk , because I was in the early days of the early years of Europe , and my unk and unk .
unk and unk , I found a big rock , and I found the unk , unk unk , unk , unk , a piece of paper , and he
That would cost a lot of cost , but it would n't be more than a unk in the night , but I thought I was able to do that
I 'm a unk unk , and we know how much the brain is stress .
It turns out out what 's going down , it 's true to the unk and the unk .
The next morning , I had a little bit of unk , and I was worried about the hole in the window , I had to think about it ,
Only when I went to the unk -- in the unk , I realized that my left was missing .
So , I went to 40 to 40 years old , and I went back to my house , and I went back to the airport , I went to
I had a lot of time in thinking about eight hours .
And I asked myself if there are things that I can do , which I can do , which I can do with the power of the bad things to
Or , at least at least , if something happens , the probability that it 's an oil disaster .
So I thought about it , but my thought was a month later .
I was at home with my colleague colleague called unk , and the unk , and he told me about unk unk from my eyes and unk , and I
He had this guy from unk unk , who had a couple of years ago , wrote a little unk .
You know what the message is unk .
And if there 's a unk , there 's a unk and try to figure out what 's wrong ?
And in unk , like unk , you look to figure out what it would go wrong , and then you try to figure out what you can do ,
What I 'm going to talk about today is a few things that we can form in a form of unk .
Some of them are obvious to others .
I start with unk .
unk your home to a place for the things that you get .
That sounds like this , and it 's also , but it 's a lot of science , which is based on our own memory .
A part of the brain , which is called the unk of thousands of years , has to look at all sorts of things in the place where you can
The unk is part of the brain , which is unk in London .
It 's the part of the brain that 's going to be able to look at their own .
And if you ask yourself , someone else did this experiment , which was the smell of smell , and they were looking at their window .
They did n't use it , but the unk , these were developed in the brain to find things .
That 's really good for things that do n't get much , but not so good things to move .
That 's why we are unk , unk and unk .
unk in the house is a place for your unk -- a guy on the door , maybe a nice unk .
For your unk , a certain protein .
For your unk , a certain table .
If you have a certain place in the place , and you 're going to be able to get your things , and if you look for them .
What about travel ?
Do you take a unk unk from your name on your unk , your unk , unk unk , it 's what it 's like in the cloud .
That 's where you can move away when these things are lost or unk .
These are very simple things .
Do n't worry about stress in the brain .
unk is unk and unk .
And of course , in the course of unk unk , it turns out that if you do n't feel in your best form , and it has to be
There 's probably not a situation situation if you have to do with a medical decision .
Some of all of us are going to be in the situation , a very important thing to have to do about your health care , or one of the
So I want to talk about it .
I 'm going to talk about a special special language .
But this is what it 's like , for example , to make a decision decision , and in order to make decisions in the unk and social -- every
So let me go to the doctor , and says , " I 've got your results from the back to your lab , and you 're going to be
Well , you know all of the best that you can do with high risk of unk diseases , heart disease .
And so you think , you do n't have a good job , and she says , " I would like to tell you what to help you get to
You know , you know , and they know that they can use the drug drugs in the world , you know , you know , you know , people
So you think , " Yes ! Give me the unk . "
But in this point , you have a question to ask a question to ask you to tell you about the most doctors do n't want to talk about and
Over the number of resources .
What 's the right ?
It 's the number of people who have a drug , or a surgery , or a process , you 've got to be able to change a person in
You think , what is this for a crazy ?
The number is one .
My doctor would n't help me if it does n't help .
But the medical work does not work .
This is not the doctor in the case when someone is , when I 'm like this .
We have the laws of unk without unk .
unk percent , 90 percent of all of the money only about 30 percent of the people are about people .
What do you think , is the number of the tools for most of unk ?
How many people have to do before before it helped ?
300 .
This is a unk of unk unk unk unk and unk unk , unk unk .
I 've spent the numbers .
300 people have to be a year ago before a heart attack or a unk .
Now , you probably think , " Okay , " I 'm going to get a unk .
Why not ? Give me the word . "
But here you have to talk to another one and ask , " Tell me the side of the side . "
For these drugs , there was five percent of the patient patients .
And in fact , there are terrible things -- unk unk unk , unk unk -- and you 're thinking about , " five percent , probably I 'm not
But a moment .
Remember that stress stress you do n't realize .
Think about how you can do this , you ca n't do the unk in the moment of self .
300 billion people who have one person . One person has helped , five percent of all over these are from the side of the side is 15 .
It 's 15 times more likely to tell you that it 's not to help .
I do n't say if you 're going to do that , or not .
I 'm just saying you should talk about your doctor .
The unk , it 's basically the unk of unk .
They have the right to this information , to decide whether you want to be able to do with the risks .
You think I think I 've got these number as a unk , and this is a common number of unk .
For the unk of unk , men , men , 50 percent of the cancer is cancer because of cancer , there are the number of unk .
Right , we 've been able to be able to be able to do it before , a person has helped .
And here 's the side side of 30 percent of the patients .
This is unk , unk , unk , unk , unk , unk .
When they look at the end of 50 percent , they 're doing these things , they 're just one or two years .
The idea for the unk unk unk is to think about the questions that you might ask to think about the conversation .
They do n't want to be yourself in the moment .
And you should also think about things like life .
Because you can win the choice that you want to have a unk , life or a life life that would be very serious ?
Over you should n't talk about it , your family and friends .
They 're going to be in the moment of unk , but at least they 're thinking about this kind of thinking .
In stress , your brain is unk , and one of the things that will happen when there are lots of light .
There 's an interesting reason for that .
unk with a unk , you do n't need your unk or your unk , or your immune system , because your body is unk , and you do n't
unk is one of the things that are the unk of the unk of the unk , unk , like " unk and his colleagues .
So we need to train these kinds of situations in the way .
The most important thing to realize is that all of us are .
We will all of all of us and fail .
It 's about what 's going to be able to be able to make the effects of the consequences , or the unk of the water 's bad things from
To go back to the unk night in unk , when I went through my journey , I asked my unk , I had a unk on the door ,
And I have to say , I 've always made a bunch of unk and a bunch of email that I have n't read .
I 'm not quite unk , but I see an organization as a process , and I 'm on the way .
Thank you .
unk , " unk , " I mean , " unk is my unk . "
It means " unk . "
If you have a unk , and the play has a unk unk , you have to play .
Two , " unk . "
Four unk , " unk unk .
This is my unk unk unk unk , which shows how much thousands , " unk , " you 've never seen silence .
That 's my current definition of silence : a very nice sound .
I want to tell you something about the American American unk , unk , unk , and a little bit of my background .
unk unk came down to the 19th century of America , and in the course of the streets of the local system , it was already known as the known
So she 's about 200 years ago .
I was born born , and I was taught that sound is not part of my life .
At that , I believe it .
Today I do n't know it was n't true .
unk were a big part of my life , and I came up in every day .
When a unk unk in a world has been able to be able to live in a Arab country , unk unk , the rules , unk , behavior ,
How can I sound sound ?
I look at human behavior and the response .
People like me , they sound sound .
I 'm learning and unk behavior .
At the same time , I looked at unk , and I see people like me .
That 's what I 've learned to say , " unk the door . "
" Do n't go so much more than if you 're at the screen -- you 're on the screen . "
" unk , not , and while you eat , you do n't have to click the plate . "
All these things I call " unk sound . "
Maybe I think more of a sound sound than the average unk ever .
I 'm a sound in unk .
I 'm waiting for unk , unk unk , which is next .
So this drawing .
unk , to decide .
unk , unk .
unk , unk .
You 're looking at the unk -- there are no notes between the lines .
Because the lines of sound can unk the unk and unk .
In the unk , the sound is unk .
This is a sign for unk unk .
A look at five blue lines .
It does n't feel , of course , with your thumb up to the top .
In my drawings , I 'm looking at four lines .
In the year of 2008 , I had the opportunity to go to Iraq , Germany , to travel , for a unk .
I had been working as a unk .
In this summer , I was looking at different places , and I was looking at a place to the next morning , I realized that there was no art
At the sound of the future , and I realized that there was no visual art , but it was unk .
So I was in my art art .
Will me get more from the art ?
I realized that it was n't the case .
I knew .
I know him so well that I ca n't just be able to listen to my emotions .
I could actually feel it or something like this , or even as an idea .
And so I decided to give the unk of sound and unk .
I decided with all of what I was looking at , and it was unk .
I started a new unk .
When I looked at the unk of unk , I got the support , and that I got .
I realized it was like money , power , control control .
In my mind , I always felt that the sound was in unk .
unk are so powerful that they 're going to do with my work or unk .
I decided to be unk .
There 's a strong culture around the word language .
And only because I 'm not my experience of music , it seems to be a society that I could n't have a voice .
So I have to work with people who are doing more than me and support my voice .
So , I 'm able to be able to believe in society today .
In the school , in the work and work in groups , I work with different unk unk .
unk voices are my voice and identity .
You can help me .
Your voices are self - currency .
By making my voice unk , I 'm a unk of unk , like a unk , very high level .
When I do n't do that , I 'm not unk , I feel that I could be able to do in the unk , and not a form of
With the same as my new unk , I was in the world of music .
I really realized that the music between music and unk .
For example , for example , is not a unk , not completely unk on paper .
The same is a concept in unk .
They are both in unk and unk -- which means that small changes the whole meaning of unk and unk .
Here 's a piece of metaphor , so they do better understand how it works .
Imagine a unk .
unk will go into many different unk unk unk .
And if you look at each other hand in a different unk -- like unk , unk , unk , like two , and so on , they 're playing
unk , there 's more like a little bit -- all 10 minutes have to be able to go back to the idea of an idea , or an idea
If you have a button of the unk , it would have a different meaning .
The same thing in the music , which is unk , and sound .
In unk , you can play with play with different unk different ideas .
For example , the sign of unk unk unk .
This is the sign of unk unk .
I look at you .
I leave you .
Oh ! unk !
Oh , oh .
What do you look at ?
unk .
And then I thought , " What if I unk through music ? "
If I have a sign , and I 'm going to do it again , and it 's a kind of visual music .
This is one of the signs for the day " the sun . "
That 's " unk . "
If I do it , and I think it looks like a piece of music .
unk ...
The same for the whole night . "
" The whole night . "
This is unk unk , unk in this drawing .
This led me to three different things from night , " The last night , " of " night , " all the day after all . "
unk has the third of a lot more than more than the other two .
This one is like time in unk unk , and how to change the body changes in the unk .
For example : unk unk is a hand , unk two hands on the next day , and in the body , and the body is in the body and
The first example is a long ago . "
Then of course , " unk , " and the last , my favorite , with a very famous and crazy idea , " it was . "
" unk " is " unk " with a special unk of four unk . "
I 'm going to use the word " unk " I think we 're going to do it . "
So , unk , right hand hand , unk left hand hand .
The unk are on the head and the breast .
I 'm going to show you a show of unk , " unk unk . "
Can you imagine me ?
All the hands up .
Now we 're going to go back to the head and the chest , like " unk " or " at the same time . "
Yeah .
" unk " in unk unk unk .
unk unk unk , as you know , you can be a visual tool , based on online cultures and unk in all the world .
As a second , I want to show you this show -- you do it again .
And this is this .
This is " unk unk . "
Now the third one , please .
And again .
This is " unk . "
Now all three three things together .
" unk , " unk " and unk . "
Well done , you all .
Do you look like a three - dimensional signs that you can see all of your head and unk , but they were very different things .
It 's amazing to look like life and unk unk , like the music .
But we live today in a very unk unk world .
Only because it does n't sound sound , it does n't have a social company .
We need to think more of the social self - called unk and unk to create its own self - called unk .
This one might have to be able to change a society .
Maybe the people who realize that you ca n't be able to be able to learn to learn to learn to learn music to learn music .
unk is so dead , and I wish that you have the same experience .
I want to thank you to your ears to open your eyes open to our culture and our visual language .
And you never know , you 're in love .
Thank you .
When I told my parents , you know , " You ca n't make it unk . "
freedom was with responsibility .
But my imagination gave me a lot of wonderful places where everything was possible .
So , I grew up in a bubble of unk , and they said better than in a bubble of the sun , because , for example , let 's
With the time I learned that they do n't make a lot of them , and they do n't very well .
unk : And I 'm now , and I 'm growing up and unk unk and innovation in Hong Kong .
It does n't have a long time to get my students on the beach , and you 're going on unk .
As a good citizens , we do n't go there -- and no , he does n't hurt , but if he did , he did n't like me .
It 's sad , but it 's more than 80 percent of the oceans .
This is a reality reality .
unk , we moved up with unk , and we were going to go up with unk , unk unk , they looked at the microscope , they were unk
But it takes a long time , and it 's very expensive , so it 's very hot , very big , unk .
But with my students in the age between six and 15 , we would have a better way to find a better way .
And so we took our little unk in a house .
We built these little unk , with different ways to do with small kids .
And I have to say , " unk with unk are great and sure .
Not really .
So , back to me .
We made a lot of plastic , and it 's not similar in the sea , which is very small , because it 's going down .
And so we work .
I 'll take a student 's students .
My job is to find the best idea of any of the unk , and to do this with something , it 's important .
So after that , we decided to do that instead , instead of unk , we do n't use the unk .
So we create a picture of unk with a robot robot .
The next step is called unk unk .
We are so fast at the food system when we 're working at work .
We built in unk and unk unk unk , which made a unk , slowly , and slowly , through the water , and in the water , it 's
So we 're looking at the unk , the unk of the computer , the computer is on the structure of this image and the size of all of the
We 've got this invention to step forward , and online online to a page called " unk , " in the hope that someone has even better .
The thing about the project was that the students had a local problem , and they were trying to do it .
But my students in Hong Kong are Hong unk .
They look at them , they are on the Internet and they have about this picture .
A kid , 10 years ago , one of the unk , with a unk , with the hands of the world , the world 's unk in South Africa
They were very shocked , because this is the water that they drink , and they are in the water , the water in the water -- this is the
You can see that the water is unk , which is unk , that 's the hot water , it 's all about it , and it 's hard to
But there 's a relatively simple technology called unk , which you can see what 's in the water .
So we built a built with a prototype of a unk , which you can see in different ways , which can be different from what they can help in
So we unk these elements in the prototype and hundreds of unk .
And the great thing about this project was that the next one of the people on the city of the brain , or the unk of my students and their
I was on the second experiment , and she wanted to take a step -- and maybe I think of a very important problem that I was on the heart
I 'm a half - year - old , and we say , " unk , and maybe you remember the earthquake in Japan .
It was so unk that there was a variety of unk unk -- they were called the tsunami -- and these were actually found a lot of cities in the
More than 14 people were on the dead dead .
And that was also the unk of unk in the unk , a unk unk .
Today , I read it in unk , which is about 300 million tons of unk in the Pacific .
Today , it shows the entire Pacific from the unk of unk .
Even from the West , you can see everywhere .
On the map of it , it 's like if most of the majority of the coast of unk , and most of you can see , it 's blue
Well , it 's actually more complicated .
I 've been in every year since the crash after the unk went to unk , or two other day in the country , in the river , and that
Of course we did n't do it , because they did n't get their parents .
But we ended up all of the night " -- " -- they 're going to take a different unk .
It may seem like they would n't be serious , but they did it because they get the rest of their lives in their lives .
So we took them the data from the next day , and our new approach -- and unk , etc , etc , etc , etc .
And we built a very , very unk , unk map of the area of the region .
So we built a unk , a unk , unk unk to unk the unk , and unk water , to unk water .
So we could look at the unk of the unk in the unk and unk in the ocean .
That was a unk .
Now , in this process , we have an article , which was like the unk , as soon as soon as a result .
We went down to unk miles away from unk , and unk with the unk in the edge of the sea , which was developed with us , and we
We put the back to a little bit of unk and hundreds of hundreds of different steps , and we built a map of the sea level of unk ,
You can see a unk -- from a local city and a global problem .
It was very exciting in these different steps , but in very simple open source .
But at the same time , it 's been unk , because we 've been able to measure the unk .
We have n't even started to find solutions for these problems .
So I ask myself why we do n't just want to take you and try to make better ways to understand these things .
The classroom was in a few years to come to us , so we found a unk in Hong Kong , and we found it in a very large -
It 's in unk , in Hong Kong , and we 're working on the center with wood , chemistry , chemistry , biology , biology , and it 's
A place where the kids and children are playing .
It 's a place where you can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to live in
unk !
We ask questions like , " Is there the future to unk with energy energy ?
For example .
Or we can look at the birth of the older than they can use -- we can use the unk in cool , electrical devices ?
unk , oil and unk unk .
We can not afford the kids from the reality of reality , because we need our imagination to be able to find solutions .
So , unk , unk , unk -- we have to create the new generation that are able to change the environment and people who can do something .
Thank you .
Two unk unk , two unk unk .
One is from thousands of unk , the other one is one single unk .
The one is unk , the other protein .
One is in the environment , the other thing that creates this .
The one of the nature is designed to be different from them .
Now , he said , he would see in the unk of a character , which is about to fight .
The unk was in unk .
But you ca n't do not .
They grow .
In our unk of the cells , the cells , we put all the information that we can do with the function and each other cell needs .
unk are also consequences .
unk years of the revolution in the world of the design of the unk and the unk .
unk have a world of many of them , and they have the idea of designers and the architect that they were taught in their objects as a kind of
But you can find nature in nature in nature .
Take the human skin .
The skin in his face is thin and unk .
The skin on the back of his body is not smaller .
One of them , as a unk , is the other than a unk , but it 's the same skin , no parts , no unk .
This system is unk in its own function , which is the size of its skin .
Here 's a screen screen screen to show my social unk unk , the unk of all of the media , unk and unk and unk and unk , between
These two unk , my left hand , and left - hand brain , unk , and they 're going to tell the two of them behind me .
Just to say , I 'm working on these two unk , to move from me from the surface of the light and the rise to move .
You ask yourself , why ?
Why was n't that 10 or 10 years ago ?
We live in a period of time , an extraordinary time , in the four areas of unk and designers , we could n't have access access .
These areas are built in design , which we can create complex forms of unk , we can use 3D 3D , which allows it to create parts of the
This is the unk of these four areas of my team and I .
These are the heads and my hands students .
We build objects , structure and structures in all sorts of unk , like this , with the unk with a unk , unk with a unk unk , the
Here we have the unk unk , a unk artist , architecture , and developed a unk , which is going to be able to see the unk of the
In our next project , we have the opportunity to create a unk and a unk , and the film for a unk unk unk unk unk unk unk --
unk with my unk unk unk unk unk unk unk , and unk , without the unk between the cells . I 'll show you more objects like this .
This is unk unk and unk , in unk unk .
This is the heart of a human body , and that 's the resolution of a cultural unk .
And so a designer that could be able to have access to these unk unk , and they have no tools , they can create products that are not just
Then we built a piece of a chair chair -- a chair with a structure , and at the same time .
unk : unk , my unk , and I found inspiration in the nature of nature , the design of light unk unk .
We took the surface with the different properties that were unk in the unk , and color color , unk the unk of the human body .
How in the nature of the surface of its function is not limited by natural materials , but through unk and unk change .
But is nature ?
Is there in nature ?
I grew up in a unk unk home , but when I was young , I read my story stories from the Bible of the Bible , and I was
She said , " Well , the third of the unk unk unk the Earth to a unk growing . "
In the first time , it should n't have a difference between the unk , and they are unk .
The whole tree was growing .
Instead , the country in the trees , unk and tribes .
The Earth was built in many parts .
I 'm going to say , " What if design was a single part of the most part ?
Would we have to live a better ?
We were looking for the material , a kind of unk unk material , and we found it .
This is the unk unk unk on the planet , which is called unk every year of thousands of millions of organisms like unk , unk , unk , unk
If we have its unk unk , we could build structures structures from a part .
And we did .
We called " unk unk unk " -- we have a bunch of unk , unk , unk , unk and unk .
Through the chemical chemical , we have a huge range of properties , of dark , unk and unk , unk and sustainable .
In order to build in a large scale , we built a unk unk with a few unk .
The robot unk unk in the unk and unk unk in a structure of a material that was 100 percent .
If the parts are done , you 're going to get into them , and they 're looking at the air of their natural natural .
So why do we do it in other parts ?
The unk , the unk of the unk were unk , from the unk of unk , the first one billion years ago , on Earth Earth , as we
With our unk unk in Harvard and MIT , we 've discovered a bacteria that made the atmosphere from the atmosphere of carbon dioxide and sugar .
For the first time , we could have developed structures with unk unk , unk unk , and in the scale scale , we looked on .
A unk unk .
With an area of unk , one of the most famous life on this planet , with water and a little bit of biology , we developed a structure of
The best part of it is that the unk are unk in the environment , where they are in the ocean , you can see it in the Earth ,
The environment in our cities , the same unk , was the solar system .
We were looking for an opportunity to use unk unk for unk .
And we had to bacteria bacteria and our unk control .
We developed our own parts of the elements of the new forms of unk , but we 've been able to have a unk and unk .
Now , I 've been able to see biology as a unk , but instead of unk unk , you can create new biological patterns in very small .
This is called unk .
We 've built our own principles in 3D , to control control of the rivers of the river .
In our first hand , we were two .
One is unk .
They live in our oceans and in unk .
The second thing , the bacteria , which is the human being unk .
One piece of light in the sugar , which is used to use these sugar and unk ; it 's useful for the environment .
These two people are in the world never .
In fact , they never found them .
They 've got to be here in the first place , within a unk relationship .
Imagine it in evolution , not natural selection , but evolution is design .
To have these relationships have a space in a room , we developed a unk , which is the unk of the unk , and the unk , and the
And then we took these laws on the human body , where they were looking for the unk system .
Where we wanted to go more , we wanted to get more unk .
This unk unk is 60 feet long if you 're going to do it .
That 's half like a unk , and you do n't like our kids .
And here in TED , it 's the first time -- our first unk unk , unk unk in life in unk .
Thank you .
Mary said , " We are unk creatures , just half . "
What if the design could be half of them ?
When we can build structures , the living matter ?
What if we were going to be able to change the brain cells that could take our skin cells to control the tissue , and our bodies ?
Imagine it as a kind of biology .
In this whole of unk , " unk , " on the planet , it was n't for me to think about it , but they have an opportunity to
I call " unk . "
We have to go back to nature .
Now , you know that you can make 3D 3D unk in unk , and the nature does n't do that .
It 's growing and unk .
The unk is a unk architecture , a unk for the unk .
Not 3D 3D unk is going to be able to measure this deep level .
The unk does n't use two materials , but two protein in different levels .
One is like a structure , which is like a unk or a pair of the unk .
That happens in all sorts of things .
The unk unk unk in their environment -- they create a unk -- and it starts to create a unk of water .
unk , and the two forces of life , in a single material .
In order to understand how this complex process , we can see a little bit of unk in the head of the unk , the unk .
We put them in a box with a unk system , which we had 3D 3D particles , and I developed this complex architecture of unk .
But when we were able to unk the unk on a level , not within a box , we realized it could also have a unk , and it would
We built different environments , different ways , and we discovered that the shape , the structure of the structure of the surface of the surface of the environment ,
unk are going to be unk in many times a lot of unk , their unk and unk .
Through the design of this , we gave the unk of a form , without a single device .
They would be normal , and we could build these things .
So we took this process in unk .
We were able to build a map of silk , and they were in our lab .
We knew that , in unk and unk unk , we looked at a unk graph , the distribution of light and light in our structure .
We made it , or unk , the unk and the heat , and the unk structure on the structure .
We were ready to get the unk .
We have six million people from online online online .
After four weeks ago , they were ready with us .
We put them down down to the bottom of the unk , while they were unk , they were unk , and they get eggs , and the life starts
unk unk , he had the unk , and he was right .
By unk , of course , unk unk , it 's going to get the unk of his unk .
In two or three weeks ago , 500 500 feet , 500 million feet .
unk , it 's also at the same time .
After unk , there are the unk million million eggs .
And you could use this for a competition for 250 million dollars .
These are these two unk .
It 's a unk of a unk , a little bit of the gap .
If there 's the last part of the design , of course , the products and the buildings , our lives , to create an area of the material ,
A one in a new design design , a new age of design , which is , of course , in nature , design design for nature , which is
Thank you .
Give you hand , if you 've ever asked , " What do you want to get when you 're big ? "
They look at how old you were , when you asked this question for the first time .
Let me show you the fingers .
unk . Five five . Five five . Five five . Okay . Okay . Okay .
Now raise your hand , if you ask the question , what you 're going to do when you 're big ? "
unk of fear .
I 'm somebody who has never asked that question , " What do you get when you 're big ? "
The problem was n't that I had no interest -- it was more than I had a lot of people .
In the high school , I wrote English , English and art , and I 've been played in the unk , " unk unk unk . "
Maybe you have heard of us .
After the high school , it went out of a couple of time , and I started looking at a self - interest , and I 'm really interested in
That 's what I 'm trying to do , because of course , because I 've spent so much time and energy , and sometimes money .
But finally , the unk of the unk , the feeling of that , " I 've got to understand that it 's not a challenge , more than that
Then I need to go .
And then again , a little bit more interesting interest , something else , and I was interested in this topic , and I said , " Yes ! I
And finally , I 'm going to do that .
But then I 'm going to do something completely new and new , and it 's in a unk .
This year ago , a few years ago , to me , for two reasons .
First of all , I was not sure how I was only one of the most interesting interests in the world .
I thought , eventually , I 'd like to tell some of my friends , and I remember the unk .
The second reason for my belief was personal personal personal personal .
I had n't worry about something that was not true that I had n't been talking about , because I had nothing to be .
I was scared that I was unk unk , but I was afraid of myself , fear , fear of my own success .
If you think of my story , and I feel that you should ask a question , which I had , I would have asked them .
Do you have where you 've learned what 's wrong or wrong about it .
I 'm going to tell you where you 've learned : you 've got through our culture .
" What do you want to be if you 're big ? " We 're going to ask the first question when we talk about five years old .
In fact , does n't care what you say when you 're so young .
The question is going to look like , " What I 'm going to say , " I want to be a unk , " or " I want to
Give you a unk .
But while we 're moving , we 're going to ask this question , and in different ways -- so I 'm going to be high school students , which
And eventually eventually , what you want to do is when you 're big ? " from the back of the process of the time , what 's going to
Why ?
While this question of all of you would have to do is , what they might have , they were not able to do what they could be able to
And basically , it can be exactly the opposite -- if you ask yourself what you want to do , you ca n't be able to give you a few
You need to decide . "
This is Dr. unk unk -- he 's unk and unk .
This is a colleague of unk , just after a magazine called unk , unk , teacher and teacher .
But most of the kids have never seen people like this .
They 're always saying they have to decide .
But it 's more than more .
The idea of a life is unk in our culture .
It 's the idea of the unk , or the true true thing that we have all of our time in this world for a big thing about . And
But what if you 're somebody else ?
What if you 're looking for many different things , and many different things want to do ?
For people like you 're not a place in this system .
So , you might be unk .
They have the feeling of your life .
And maybe you have the feeling that you do n't think about something .
It 's all about you .
They 're just a unk .
A unk is a human with a lot of social and creative unk .
That 's how you get the mouth of full .
Maybe it helps it to be in three parts of unk : unk , potential potential and unk .
Or you can use one of the other words , like unk unk .
In the unk , it was the ideal , in many , in many areas .
unk unk was like " unk . "
Look at a term , or you 're your own own .
I 'm going to say , I think it 's very important that our society is not in a identity of a different part .
It 's very easy to unk your unk , or as suffering , you have to fight .
But in the conversation with other people , and he wrote to write my website , I learned that there 's a lot of the big risks with it .
I 'm going to tell you three of these unk unk .
One : unk .
This is the combination of two or two more areas , where they do n't create a new way .
unk unk and unk unk unk on the two of them , their unk , unk , unk , unk , design , design and design , when they were
unk unk , unk unk .
unk and unk had had this unique idea not even though , because of their skills and experiences .
unk innovation .
Of course there are new ideas .
unk can be unk with a lot of unk in many unk .
The second one of the unk is unk in learning .
If you have to be interested in something , you know , it 's full of them .
We put everything on what we get in the hands .
We are also used to be unk , because we 've been often in the past , it means that we 're less afraid of being new , and we
That 's where you have a lot of unk skills that we can do all of what we 've learned , in new new ways , but we 're going
unk unk is unk and unk .
When kids , they were working on the incredible ability to create a unk .
Now , it 's the ocean unk , which she knows .
Before she was born , it was unk unk .
They were looking at unk with unk , when they were able to use it in unk , that it helps to be able to look at the unk of
It 's just a lot of water , a little bit , you know , when you go to the end .
Maybe you look at this in a very different area of what you 've never seen .
The third of the unk unk is unk . This is the ability to be able to change everything in what 's in a particular situation .
unk unk is sometimes unk , sometimes sometimes unk , sometimes of course , sometimes , sometimes , and sometimes unk unk .
He 's unk because he 's good work .
He gets more more than that , because there are different things that can come out of his clients .
The magazine , of course , " unk unk than the most important in the 21st century .
The unk change is so fast and unk that these people and organizations are going to be able to be able to change the unk .
unk , fast , and unk , three - dimensional skills , the unk , unk , they can lose , if you 're using it , to count .
As a society , we have a very interested in interest in unk , they 're going to be themselves .
Right there 's a lot of complex , unk problems in the world . We need creative creative that they do .
Imagine in the heart of you are a unk .
And in the prison , you were sure you would be unk .
Do n't worry about you .
In fact , some of the best in the team of them and a unk .
The unk are on the reason , and the ideas will be unk in the history of knowledge .
It 's a wonderful part .
We all need to life , and I 've been able to make it in our nature .
Unfortunately , it 's mostly unk , just more like their unk .
unk , if there 's one thing that you can get from my talk , and I hope it 's the question : take your self - unk , as
If you 're in your heart , you should be safe .
That 's where your best work can work .
But the unk unk here , which is the only one in the last few minutes later , they have to say , " I 'm going to give you
unk your unk in the unk .
unk your unk .
You know , in fact , to create a sense , a unk , unk life .
What 's more important ? unk , the world needs us .
Thank you .
unk was a woman called unk unk in a medical health .
unk unk . She could n't be able to remember the details of my life .
The name of his name was unk unk .
unk did n't know how he could help it , but he would care about it , until it was unk unk .
After her , she had a unk of unk , and he found unk unk and unk unk in the brain that he had never seen before .
Actually , it 's really amazing .
If we were living today , we would have been able to do it as well as early years before .
unk was Dr. unk .
unk unk was the first patient , who had a disease cancer , that we 're going to be Alzheimer 's disease .
In unk , the medicine has made progress .
We 've got antibiotics and antibiotics , which are dying of unk , a lot of cancer , HIV cancer , HIV drugs , HIV disease , heart disease and
In the treatment of disease , we have never made progress .
I 'm part of a team of scientists who had done for 10 years after a disease for Alzheimer 's disease .
So I think it 's always about .
unk is about 40 million people in the world .
By 2050 , it 's about 150 million people -- that 's what you can get from many of you .
If you 're going to wait for hundreds of years or more older than you can be more likely to be able to be able to be able to get
In other words , it probably probably is that you can be able to be able to be able to be able to Alzheimer 's Alzheimer 's disease or a
And in the United States , it 's about 200 billion dollars a year .
The American unk unk is a fifth of their teeth for Alzheimer 's disease .
unk is already the most complex disease , and it 's aging as soon as the cost of 2050 is going to happen .
It may be able to be Alzheimer 's disease for our generation , which is one of the most social and social challenges .
And yet , we 've never seen about it .
From the 10 percent of the deaths in the world 's disease , the only one that we ca n't save the disease , or we can control .
We know less than 25 years ago , because we spend less time and money in their education .
The U.S. government has a year - five - year - year - old dollars for more than cancer , for the disease of Alzheimer 's disease , and even
The missing resources have a cause of unk , a lack of unk .
Because you have a few people who know what it should be heard about : disease is a disease and we can use them .
Almost all of the last year for 30 years , it 's about 30 million of all of the scientists who were unk with unk .
We thought unk was a normal and unk part of that .
But we also have to have a single body of a brain brain with the brain of a disease , as the brain can also be able to understand the
The damage of the brain does n't just have to be able to have a huge impact of the mental skills and the memory , but it also does n't
So , as I mentioned , again , 25 years ago , a hundred years ago in the brain unk and unk unk .
We do n't know much about this century .
Today we know that these are unk .
A unk can be able to look like a piece of paper , which is usually a form of unk unk .
On the paper , there are unk dots .
If it 's going to be true , there are these dots on the unk .
Sometimes it 's going wrong , and some things are on the outside .
That leads to unk the unk and unk , which is going to be able to get large and unk .
This is what we see in the brains of Alzheimer 's patients .
The last 10 years we 've been working at the University of Cambridge , working to understand how this works .
unk the things that are going to be unk , it 's so complex like the unk .
The unk of a unk change is not something that happens to another one to the city .
We need to be able to find the right , and then the drug , it 's called it .
Until recently , we were unk unk and unk the best .
Now we 've got a team team , unk , unk , who said , " unk , engineers and scientists .
And together , we could have a very important unk , and we test a new kind of medicine , which is just going to take this step , and
These are some of our results .
No outside of our room have never seen .
In these videos , you can see the effects of the drugs in the classroom .
These are all trees . You can see that they 're normal .
It 's in the opposite of the same ones that they are in unk with people in the disease .
You can realize that they 're very powerful .
Let 's give these little back to the early brain that we can see that they can be healthy and a normal life expectancy .
This is just a very different reason , and we realize that this is that this is that the disease can be a disease , that we can understand and
After four years ago , there 's a very long - hope hope for the next 10 years in the next 10 years , and the hope that will be
And it 's not about scientists like me -- it 's about .
We ask you to make consciousness for Alzheimer 's disease ; it 's a disease , and we can use it if we 're going to try it .
In other words , the patients and their friends , they were working in the government , the unk , scientists , unk and scientists .
This was critical to the treatment of HIV in the late ' 80s .
Today we look at the same level of violence against cancer .
BJ : unk patients are not often able to be able to do themselves and their families , the unk , the day , and day , they 're not
So it 's very important .
unk is true for the most part of the unk .
Who has a brain , right ?
Today , there 's 40 million patients patients like unk who are not going to move into the unk .
Give you a voice and you 're a cure .
Thank you .
And I wrote a article in the unk Museum of " The New York Times in the last year .
" Do you to say it in love . "
In the article , it 's about a psychological study , the love of love in the lab and try to test this test for me in the last summer
The process is quite easy to say , " unk people say , " unk minutes of personal personal questions , and do n't talk about five minutes in the
Here 's a couple of 12 : 12 , 12 : If you have to find a new or an eye , you could see what ?
AB : When did you see the last time ?
And alone ?
How you can see the questions of personal personal personal personal .
The number of me are very happy to say , " Look at what you 're going to tell you -- it 's very honest , say things that you
When I first got a few years ago , this was a very few years ago , and that was the unk that was two of the six months of
And I was very , of course , of course , in love , you know , but of course , I was really curious .
When I had the chance , the study had to do an experiment that I would n't love to love .
But we have it , and ...
I thought that was a good story , and I sent them a few months later on the unk .
And she was born in January , and it 's April , I think that some of you ask us whether we 're all together .
I think you ask the question , because this question in the last few months months .
Today I want to talk about these questions .
But that 's later .
In the week , I was very nervous .
I had the last year in a book about unk years ago , so I used to talk about my unk in my blog .
A blog comes from a few hundred times a couple of unk , and they were just like my Facebook friends , and I thought that my New York Times
It felt a lot of attention for a water relationship .
As it turns out , I was something wrong .
unk was published on a video online online , and I saw my unk on the street on my blog .
Until , at the morning , the morning and show unk unk .
Within a month of the paper , she had eight million times , and I was to be able to think about the unk of this kind of attention to
One thing is there , to be honest and unk about his unk book , something else is different because it 's trying to figure out that your life has
If you ask for every day of every year , they ask them , " they 're still the same thing : Are they still going together ?
In fact , I 've been able to talk to this talk to my email -- to go back to the back of their lives , and then they were
They were from students and unk and unk people like this .
I had unk and I asked them .
I gave a talk and a woman called " unk , where your friend ? "
I started unk .
I understand that the unk unk .
If you have over his relationship in a international newspaper , you have to talk about people who do n't want to talk about people .
This was a big thing , but I was not just ready .
The third of them seemed to be unk .
The New York Times gave me a new article on this , on the front of the experience of unk unk , which was the experiment with the experiment with
It was my first time , my first relationship to unk .
I said every single one that we were both both when we started to the media .
I said , " unk unk , unk and unk unk from us .
I think I was scared , " unk -- " I 'm going to do what I did n't feel .
And I understand it : people did n't want to know how to study the study , they wanted to know whether it really works if you could make real
But this was a question I could not answer .
My relationship was just a few months ago , and I had the feeling that people had the wrong questions .
What would it mean if we 're both or not ?
If the answer is no , it would have to experience the same time with the same questions ?
Dr. unk unk wrote a book about these questions in the study of 2002 , because there was no goal of love .
Instead , they wanted to look at the relationship between the students who had the unk , unk , unk , unk unk .
Do you think about , right ?
But the study has worked .
The colleagues were also looking for a unk and a lot of unk unk , " unk unk used to be familiar with each other day .
He was in unk and unk and unk to people with political political issues .
On the unk of the story that I saw last summer , the unk of questions with unk unk , was in this paper , but never published .
A few months ago , I gave a talk to a little unk , and a student came to me , and I said , " unk , I 've
He looked at this .
" You mean , you did n't love with you ? "
" Well , " he said . "
" I think she wants to be friends . "
" But you have become friends in friends . "
" Do you feel that you 've got to look at the study ? "
He unk .
And then it 's done , " I said .
That 's not the answer that he expected .
I think . No one , the answer is to be love .
I went to this study when I was -- I was just kind of unk .
I was in the past since I was 20 years ago , which was kind of my entire life . He was my first love , and I did n't
So I went to the science .
I was working in the science of unk unk unk , and I would have hope that it would be unk .
I do n't know if I had it in the early days -- I thought , I was just for my book -- but it 's very obvious .
I hope that when I was thinking about knowledge , I never looked like this , and I felt like this .
All of this knowledge was very useful in some way .
I 'm unk in love . I 'm more proud .
I 'm going to tell you what I want .
But I can also make myself more interesting . I 'm going to be more sometimes than what 's going to be unk .
And what I love from love is not to be familiar with me or tomorrow , but it 's the human being , I still love to love .
Maybe it 's an opportunity to believe that if you ask them if we ask them whether we 're all together .
The story that the media was about the same questions that it might have to be an old love .
Maybe you might have to look at the risks of this , and it 's very interesting , because if you look in love , it 's too wonderful ,
In the moment , in your mind , you can tell you that you can lose a lot of people , and it 's true that these questions are a
But I think if it 's love to us , we 're going to be ready for the unk of the story .
The one of the story that says , " Are you going to do it ? " and you 're with a guy or not .
Instead , we should n't ask questions questions like , " How do you decide who love our love ?
How do you love when you look at the data and how you know when it 's time to love ?
How do you think about the state of unk in every relationship , or even more , how do you think about his life ?
I do n't know what you 're going to say , but I think it 's important to tell you about what it means to tell someone .
So if you want to me , the unk of my relationship is : " A year ago , a year ago , and I have a unk system ,
It 's not too black , but it 's not the same love .
It 's too simple part .
At the end of my paper , I said , " I love not just happened .
We are in love because we both both of them . "
It 's a little bit of unk to read me , because it 's not true , but because I 've never been able to do anything about it ,
I do n't have to tell you how many of us have this choice , and as many of us have to do this choice , without to know ,
I wanted to give the questions of questions and answers that my choice of someone would like to love and unk and love to say that I was in the
Instead , I had my relationship in a myth that I do n't think of myself .
What I 'd like to live my entire life is that this seems to be true .
I want to unk this , which is the title of my article , which is one of the only part that I do n't write myself .
Instead , I had the chance to make the choice of someone who love to tell me that my love , and that 's kind of , but it 's
I was with two mothers in the mountains and grew up as a kind of New York City .
This led me to the mind -- but after that later .
I 'm starting to go to eight years old -- I took a unk , I put a dollar -- a piece of paper , and a unk , I
So they 're looking for hundreds of 500 years ago , and something about the way of our species , we know , as we can eat , I had
It 's funny , because now , 30 years later , I 'm still working with paper .
And at some point , I was in London -- I like unk and unk -- and I made a unk for my mother .
I took a dictionary and a unk , and it made a kind of unk . I made it unk , there was a unk .
My mother and unk , and I 'm actually unk , so I 'm going to get more excited about the screen around the screen .
The opposite was the case . It was kind of a bigger than a square in the text .
What did I have done ? "
And this time , I made up , unk , unk , unk -- everything , what I found -- because I always wanted to figure out the objects .
I took them around , and he said , " Wow ! I can see in the sculpture .
I can look at unk unk , like the unk of a body .
So I took the things out , and I had my own unk of unk .
First , unk : unk , it seems to be easy .
And then , of course , sculpture and creatures .
This was really beautiful ; I had just unk unk .
This was cool , and then I started to show up , and show up what I did .
That was real unk !
And eventually , at some point , I came to people , unk unk .
That was great , but I would have died .
I did n't know what I should have to do .
I had every night .
I tried it with unk , and she started to show them when you were looking at a window , and then you take another one , and then another
And that worked as well , I did n't need more .
I did this for many years . And this is a big collection , which I call " unk . "
unk was inspired by unk unk unk unk , the painting of unk unk in Spain .
Do you know ?
Well , that 's a cool work .
On the time , she says .
" The unk , " I 'm unk . "
It 's almost 5,000 tons of unk , five million feet long , unk , 11 , unk , unk , was very unusual .
That 's the unk .
unk are Jesus and unk .
There 's a cave , in the unk with two groups .
They go to the unk of the world in a unk , where they are hidden .
Here they are in unk , and unk unk .
The ocean is from three elements .
Here 's a unk , unk unk .
Michael unk is in the ocean , the horizon on the unk , on unk , unk unk unk -- it 's kind of a unk in the ocean ,
This is a unk .
It comes from the water and water oil in a hand , and clouds come from the other .
Your hands are like unk , and they have to look at the balance between the planet between Earth .
That 's the one side of " unk . "
A small story .
That 's their hand , which they are .
And then on the other side , they have a stick from the clouds .
It has a five - foot foot in the unk , the unk unk .
The tail goes into a place .
I do n't know about why .
That happens .
The tail is in a unk - eye eye , unk of unk terrorists .
Do you know ?
They come from the ' 80s , unk terrorists .
Really time .
That brings us to my project .
I 'm in unk . One is " unk . "
It takes six years to be 100 years ago .
Each one is from our culture through the unk unk , there are unk , or unk .
Everybody is a kind of unk in unk , they are in groups , four , four , 12 or 12 .
They are like cells -- and they come together and share .
When you go home , it took me for years .
Every piece is like a unk unk unk with a man .
He has a unk in the chest .
That 's his head ; that 's the breast you can see the beginning .
We just go back to the body . It 's coming out of the chest , you know , " unk , " -- or not unk , or something
We do this in the process , because I do n't know every single time .
There are the unk , as you can see .
This is a body , which is shared .
This one is two books , and between between them .
You can see the one who 's going to go to the next .
Here 's a small village scene .
Do you see ?
Well , of course , this talk is about what they do .
This is a box here , which is unk .
That brings me to my last box .
A unk box called " unk unk . "
In this box , there 's a unk , a unk , a genius , a musicians , a unk , a museum , a museum , a museum ,
We take this box , and all of people live in a little bit like little particles .
And I think it should have to change the world .
You are the content and the box in the lives .
And so you come together and realize , " Hey , we 're all going to do all of this . " You know that this unk , this is
We all have all of the same , sit in the same box .
And if we do n't die and unk , we 're all very fast .
Thank you .
What do you do when you have a disease ?
It makes a unk .
But before the unk of the head in your head , there 's where the pain is , when he comes through the unk , the eye , and the
unk are the unk and unk unk , the body is a drug .
The unk of a kid is still part of that .
And this is a big problem , especially in HIV patients .
The drugs for the unk of the virus virus is good at the unk of the blood vessels in the blood and the number of unk , but they have
In these parts of the body , like the unk , the nervous system , the brain , as the brain , where the virus , and not without the
But the treatment can be able to do the virus , and then they can save the cells .
All of this leads to the problems of problems that are now HIV - based drugs that are going to be able to be able to be able to get
One day , I sat down , and I thought , " If you could n't have the HIV drugs , you do n't have the HIV - unk unk
When I was an example , the answer was on the hand : unk , of course .
unk in the unk , unk unk and diabetes , they could use it for all of them , even for the cost of drugs .
In fact , we use it to be able to unk unk holes in unk cells , and we 're going to look at the same time , and then
" How is that possible ? "
We 've got a very strong , but it 's a little bit of the inside of the cell cancer cells , and they actually put it in a liquid
The camera , and this is the drugs that 's within the code .
Before you know , it 's the hole .
Let 's test this process in unk or unk in the future , but it 's the technology of human body .
You like to ask yourself what 's going .
The answer is , in a unk device .
With the first one , the camera , we take a step on the unk of the universe , the camera , the camera , we move to this place
With the third of the head of a unk , unk unk unk , which we call the drugs , we 're using the computer to the map of the
Well , maybe , it does n't look like much .
But in the unk of this technology , the day one day to protect the planet , the virus virus in the body .
A cure for HIV .
The dream of every one of HIV HIV -- -- in our case , it 's a cure .
Thank you .
And after a decade years ago , I do n't have an organization , unk , unk groups , terrorists , terrorists , terrorists and unk .
I unk them , these are not working on someone .
My goal is to understand this war , not to understand and understand that the kind of the conflict of the fight is to be unk .
I work in place where people are in the library .
These groups can understand that the key to solve most of the conflict , because the war has changed .
A war is no longer a competition between the United States , like this .
He 's a conflict between between states and not like unk .
For example , from the unk unk unk unk between the unk and 2010 , there were unk between the state of a state - state state .
So we need to understand these groups ; we need to do it , or to help them through the process of success , success .
So how do we do that ?
We need to know these organizations .
We know much about how they fight and why they do n't know what they do .
But unk and political politics are connected to us .
It 's all part of the organization .
We can not use these groups , because we do n't know , because we do n't understand the big .
And groups groups are now complex organizations .
Let 's take the unk unk , unk for her unk unk with Israel .
But of course , in her early years , the early years ago , there was a political party , a unk , and a unk .
unk , the unk of unk , was known for their unk unk to Israel , who had been in unk .
So these groups are much more than only .
They work .
They are unk unk -- unk , TV , unk , unk and social media .
And here we have the unk magazine magazine in English , and it 's unk .
unk groups are too complex in complex unk -- no unk , but the unk company , unk , for example .
These laws are the key .
So , these can be able to put their electrical power , their unk , better and a brand .
unk groups are going to do something else : you create a lot of connections with people who are talking about unk .
They build schools , private hospitals , hospitals or unk .
The unk unk all of these services and more .
unk groups of the population in their side to the side of the state is not the security state .
The unk of the Taliban in the United States of Afghanistan , or even the beginning of the rise of the back of the end of the whole of the
Unfortunately , in the population of the population in these cases for the unk of security , you have a high price .
But in the case of unk , the unk of unk is a gap , one of the government is open to the bridge , and it allows these groups
The unk of unk in 2006 is not able to understand why the social work in the group .
Now we have a really complex picture , we 're looking at the West in groups , we just think about the unk side .
But this is not enough to understand the power of these groups , or their strategy or unk .
These groups are a unk .
They 're moving on , because they have a bridge between the government , and they 're both in the same than they have to be political . They 're
And the more complex and self - organizations organizations like these organizations are the less than we see the opposite of the state .
How do you a group like unk ?
They 're going to get a part of an area , and all of their unk , the waste of the food , the system is unk .
Is this a state ? Is it a unk ?
Or maybe something else , or new ?
And what about unk ?
The borders are not unk .
We live in a world in the United States , not in the United States , and the more states are less than two years in the Middle East ,
That 's important for governments , because these groups are going to be able to do it in China .
The power of the gap is the power of any sustainable energy .
That 's also very important for unk and unk .
If we can get four groups better , we get better than what we need to have to change the power of peace .
So , in this way , in this way , in this new competition between states and not in China , there are a military military military , but they
In order to have these goals , we need to take a unk to the unk , the unk of the unk , which allows them to be able to
Thank you .
I 'm a woman , when I 'm a unk .
And I believe in fact from my heart of equality , but I 'm afraid that it 's not good for me to say , " I 'm going to
I 'm an actor , but a more bad thing .
So I call myself a bad unk .
At least , I wrote a paper , then a book called " unk , " and then I was in unk , " unk unk .
So , as a look like me , he was looking for himself and unk unk , and I started a unk .
I want to go back .
When I was dead , I had to go back to my office , and I was kind of like unk unk , unk , unk , unk and women
Today , I look at how women are in the world , and it seems to be a completely emotional response .
But back to the unk of the people , if they were unk , I could be an actor .
As an actor , it was a unk , and it was a unk word and not a nice word .
I was born as a woman who does n't want to follow the rules that would be a lot of people themselves , and when I believe it , I
unk wants to be able to be able to be able to realize that you can look at this , and you ca n't imagine someone else else .
When I was older , I realized that I was an actor , and I 'm a very proud .
I 've got certain reason for granted , women are men .
We do the same for the same work .
We have the right for us in the world , without unk or unk .
We have the right to be able to be able to have access access to the unk and unk .
We have the right to our bodies , without our unk or unk .
We have to be right .
And more more .
When we talk about the needs of women , we have all of the other things that we live .
We are not only women .
We are people with different bodies , unk , unk , unk , unk , different from different values and other skills .
We have to have these differences and how we feel the same way we have to have .
Without these people in our unk , we do n't know .
I believe that these are obvious for granted , but to be very clear , I 'm unk .
I 'm full of unk .
I do so many things wrong with me .
I have to talk about something .
When I go to work , I 'm very happy , unk .
Although the other men -- -- these guys are unk me -- like the unk of unk unk unk unk unk unk -- that 's great .
" Look , what you 've got in your unk T .
unk , unk , unk , unk ! "
Think about it .
Do n't mean , right ?
My unk unk unk .
I believe in unk , what all of what I do n't want to do , like -- all sorts of unk , but also , of course , "
So I do n't want to do anything .
unk is my unk .
I love unk and beautiful things .
I 'm looking at " The unk " unk " and unk , and I realized that ideas might be true .
Some of my unk are unk unk .
If a woman 's the name of his name , he 's going to make the decision , and I do n't have to do it .
If a woman is going to be able to take their kids , then I 'm going to make this decision .
The problem is not to be able to do it in the economic problem , which is our society in our societies , as they do .
That 's why we should .
I unk the unk of unk , who was in the history of the unk -- the white unk , unk , unk , unk , unk , unk ,
If the good thing is , I 'm a really bad genius .
And also , as a unk , I 'm always unk .
We tend to look at a unk .
We expect them to be perfect .
When they take us , we take it back to the unk .
How I said , " I 'm totally unk unk unk , just before , before you 're just trying to unk me .
For many women , all of the things between women and unk , fear of fear called unk .
They 're going to be standing up and say , " Yeah , I 'm kidding , " fear of fear , " which means " fear , " fear
Take for example , like me , what I call them the unk .
In the last few years , it was a form of unk .
It was about the unk of unk unk unk , which was three unk in the unk , " unk . "
It was a unk unk , looking at this star , like her unk , and her young men , and they knew that the unk was to be a
In unk , we 've been talking about it to talk about whether whether was actually a miracle .
They unk their unk , instead of an adult , unk unk in the word .
We expect to unk , because we still do n't want to get so much as much as much as much , so much too much .
We go too far down to unk unk , because if we 're going to get all of the individual every single time , and we do n't get more
We do n't need it .
unk unk -- or more than unk , is a beginning .
But what happens ?
If we lose our mistakes , we have to take unk , which is going to follow the questions , and then a little bit .
If I look at music music , then I 'm going to make a demand , the artist , of course , on unk .
This artist will not be able to change what they 're talking about women in their talk about how we 're going to take them to the profit .
Of course , that 's hard .
Why has to be able to go ?
It 's hard to make a choice choice , and so simple , to make a sense .
But if I do n't have a choice of choice , I do all the women , I think , we 're all going to do and I have to
I think about three and four years old .
They are unk , unk , and unk girls , they 're unk .
I want them to live in a world where they have the most powerful creatures that they are .
I think about it , and suddenly will make better choice .
We all can have a better choice .
We can use the window when a television has been unk in women , like unk -- unk of unk .
We can click on the end of what we 're going to hear when they 're going to be less .
We can see every single time in Africa , when films are only as men , as only as men .
We can go to unk unk , if they do their own partners than a unk .
However , men can say men -- and white white unk , " No , I 'm not going to do anything in China , or you 're going to
I 'm not going to work with you or your community or not open to all sorts of people . "
Those of us who are unk , and they are in the projects that are also going to be able to go back to the roof , and we do
Without these laws , without a unk , we 're going to get very little .
We can get these little unk , very few steps , and hope that our choice to go to the unk , unk , unk , unk , unk ,
We can also be able to tell our unk -- whether we 're bad or bad .
The last one of my book " unk unk " is " I 'm not a bad word as a unk . "
This is a couple of reasons , but all of the things that happened , and she took me a long time , and then he helped me , she
There was an event .
I call it an event that I 'm going to change the thing that happens .
A few guys came to me when I was too young to have to know what boys can do to get a girl .
They were treated for me when I was .
I started to believe that I was wrong .
She gave me my voice , and I 'm not thinking about what I said , was meaning .
But -- I had writing .
And I wrote about this again .
I wrote myself in a greater version of myself .
I read the words of women who had a story like my understanding , and women , as I looked like , and what it means to be the skin
I read the words of women who showed me that I did n't speak .
I learned how to write it , and I learned like myself .
I found my voice and started to believe that my voice was about all of the potential .
And in writing , and I also found myself that if I had a little bit , and a woman would tell me , and I do n't think that
In a hand , I can make the power of all of it .
In the other , I think the truth is that I 'm just one woman .
I 'm a unk . I 'm a good woman . I 'm going to be better in what I think and what I say , and I do n't
I hope we can all of all .
I hope we all have to be a little bit more than if we have the courage to most of them .
Last year , after the first time , at home , the kids were going to go back to California in California , to go to school , or someone
The virus on the Gulf of Canada and people are more than 100 children .
The unk in this case is that there 's a cure for a child with the immune system that can be , but it 's one of the most simple
A global vaccine has been done for 50 years ago , but a lot of kids who were not unk , because their parents were aware of self - unk
But was not the book that was the discussion of psychology and Charles , who was from the British unk , unk and unk , unk and unk ?
Do n't know most of the people who have the theory , that autism does n't seem to be autism ?
Most of you know it , but there are millions of people in the world who are always afraid to be able to read autism to their children .
Why ?
I want to explain you .
This graph shows that the number of thousands of autism .
In the 20th century , it has been a very rare suffering .
The couple of unk , and they 've heard of this story , they would never think of all their lives .
Over decades , the unk had lost three or four children .
But in the early years , there was this number .
unk organizations , like unk unk unk , " unk as an example , as if you just wanted to look at a unk in unk .
So what 's happening ?
If it 's not the unk , what is it ?
If you have the people in the United States in London , as you can say , what they can say , like , " unk " unk " and
But this is not the fear of a young mother , the eye with their unk .
If the unk could be unk , then they were so close to me ?
Why did you see the early years ago ?
Five years ago , I decided to answer answers to these questions .
And I found that the cause of less in the slow and the progress of science in the power of all of the music .
The doctors were told a story about what it was like , and it was discovered , but this story has been wrong , and the result was a unk
There was a second one , a story , a story that had been in a dark side of the United States and unk .
The second story told us what happened , and how we need to move .
The first story starts with a unk called unk unk unk in John unk .
In unk , he wrote a paper , which was in the early ' 80s , who were in their own lives , and people were around around them ,
They 're moving for hours of hours , when they face the face in their hands , but they were kind of unk , when they were looking for their
Because of the patients that have been working in his hospital , unk unk , that autism is very rare .
Now , as an expert in the middle of this area , there was a lot more than 150 years ago , " unk , " and the majority of
This is not surprising , because unk unk had been a unk .
For example , after kids , unk unk unk unk unk unk , but a lot of people in unk .
He even unk that he was about 10 years ago from the other people as a unk were not unk .
unk was a smart person , but some of these theories were wrong .
He unk unk as a form of unk , which was the cold cold and unk .
These kids , he said , he lived in a unk who never had unk .
At the same time , there were some of these young patients in certain areas , like music , mathematics or memory .
A boy in his hospital has 18 18 years ago , before he had two years old .
If his mother had a unk unk , he said , " unk ! "
But they were playing these skills , they were unk that these kids were unk , they told their parents to tell their language .
So it 's been on a single thing for the families , who had a unk , and two generations of children were born in their best unk , and
Just in the 1970s , we have a theory of unk unk theory to read that autism .
unk unk , a unk unk in London , was the idea that the theory of unk , " unk , " she said to me .
And her and thank you , John unk and unk and people , and they had an adult mother , unk .
And the two knew , as hard as it was a child , like unk , no unk , unk , unk , and others , no matter , without
In order to the unk of unk , there was to be able to teach the kids for children and their families to support more support , and they were
They looked at autism in the population .
She unk the unk of unk unk unk to unk children .
Your theory showed that there was a model of a lot of deep , while the computer looked like a lot more and more complex .
Some kids could not speak at the same time on unk , or unk unk unk .
These kids did n't get in a couple of unk , so unk , and they saw many kids , much more than unk unk model .
First of all , they did n't know how to use this data .
