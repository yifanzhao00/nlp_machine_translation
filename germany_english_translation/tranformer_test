My goal in this video and the next one .
There 's an idea of the size of the Earth .
And the solar system .
If we make the galaxy and the universe .
It 's almost impossible .
But we 're going to try it at least .
Well , I think that most people who look at this video .
This is the Earth .
This is the Earth .
And just to give you a sense of what I 'm thinking about .
Now , the largest distance that we can imagine .
It 's probably about 100 miles .
You can go into a car , and an hour , maybe a half - year - old .
And about 100 miles .
On the Earth , this would be about @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That would be a point where it would look like this .
This is 100 miles .
And also , we get a little bit of a sense .
We think about the speed we can imagine .
And that would be the speed of ...
Let 's think about the speed .
One of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Maybe we can not imagine .
But let 's say that this is the fastest , which we might think .
And that 's about ...
( @@UNKNOWN@@ and there are different guys from @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ from the @@UNKNOWN@@ and everything .
It 's about 3,000 meters per second .
What 's a thousand thousand times a year .
And this is about the speed of a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
One @@UNKNOWN@@ ...
So , just to give a sense of the size of the size of the planet .
If you walk around the planet .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ , so here , is 40 years ago .
40 years ...
So if you go up with a speed .
The speed of a sphere .
Or the speed of a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , 1,000 dollars , fly .
It would like to take it to the Earth .
40 hours to see the Earth .
And you think that this is not surprising .
You may have an @@UNKNOWN@@ or @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
You do n't even get the Earth .
But yet .
San Francisco from Australia , or something .
So these are not the size yet .
Anyway , even for me , just the Earth itself .
It 's a huge object .
Now I think about the way .
The Sun .
Because the sun is a little bigger .
So this is obviously the sun .
And I think most of the people know that the sun is larger than the Earth .
And also , it 's pretty far from the Earth .
But I think many people I have .
You do n't understand all the big size of the Sun , or @@UNKNOWN@@ far from the Earth .
And just to give you a sense of that , the sun has .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ the Earth .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ the Earth .
So if we do that same experiment .
If we say , OK , I 'm going to start with the speed of a ball or a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It would be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Now , how long would it take the sun ?
So if I 'm going to go into a drive , I 'm trying to fly the sun .
Or if I was able to fly on a ball , and try to fly the sun .
It 's a full - @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It would .
Just take a long time to take the Earth .
So it would be 100 years ago . I could do it , but just as a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's about 100 @@UNKNOWN@@ of scale .
So , 100 @@UNKNOWN@@ 40 dollars .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And just to get a sense of how much more @@UNKNOWN@@ are .
I 've got the @@UNKNOWN@@ out .
Let 's measure that .
These are @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of the Earth .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That 's how long it would like to fly the Earth .
So this is @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ to fly the sun .
And that 's the speed of a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And this is at @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That 's @@UNKNOWN@@ days .
This is @@UNKNOWN@@ half a year .
It would take a half a year to fly the sun , at the speed of a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
( I write it up .
A half a year .
A half a year .
The sun is @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The sun is huge .
Now , that does n't like that or maybe not be unusual .
In fact , let me give another example of this size .
I have this diagram of the Sun .
This is a different diagram of the Sun .
We 're going to talk more about the rest of the solar system .
But here 's over here , this is the Sun .
The sun , at least at my screen when it was completely completely .
It would be @@UNKNOWN@@ in @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The Earth is just the little thing over here .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , smaller than one .
Just this little thing over here .
If I paint it painting , where the sun is actually , it would even be smaller .
The Earth would be about that ...
The Earth would be so big here .
Well , obviously not .
We have this whole @@UNKNOWN@@ in @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ class .
( you look at this , I 'm going to look at this diagram of the solar system that looks like this .
But the planet are @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Even even though these objects .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ are @@UNKNOWN@@ away from the Sun as it looks like .
So , the sun ) ) ) I 'm on the Earth ; it 's 150 million miles away from the Sun .
So the Earth is .
So this distance when the sun is the same .
If the sun would be here .
In this size , the Earth is more @@UNKNOWN@@ .
You would n't see the Earth .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But it would be 150 , would be 150 @@UNKNOWN@@ .
150 people from the Earth .
And this distance is called @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We 're going to use this expression in the next few more .
It 's just because it makes much more easier to think about it .
Sometimes I said , " @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
@@UNKNOWN@@ ...
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And just to get a sense of how much this is actually .
@@UNKNOWN@@ that we know as almost as long as fast .
That sometimes sometimes happens .
So it takes eight minutes to see the sun on Earth .
If the sun disappear , it would take the light down eight minutes .
That 's what we 're on Earth on the Earth is the Sun .
Or differently , we take back .
And we get the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So , we have 100 , we talk about 150 150 .
That 's a thousand million million .
That 's 150 million miles .
So if we fly 1,000 hours .
So we would @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ with 1,000 dollars .
150 @@UNKNOWN@@ , with the speed of a ball , or a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And to the sun , and just to get this in perspective .
If you go to the days , there are @@UNKNOWN@@ on the day .
That would be @@UNKNOWN@@ days , then we share the other days of days .
About 17 years .
If we were going to put a @@UNKNOWN@@ in the sun , it would never be 17 years ago .
If we could speed up the speed .
A ball or a @@UNKNOWN@@ would be 17 @@UNKNOWN@@ to get the sun .
17 ...
17 years ...
Or a different way of changing it .
The Sun right here over here is about five or six inches in the diameter .
If we put this in perspective .
And then this little thing here , which is the Earth , @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And this point .
So if you put it into @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Then it would be @@UNKNOWN@@ from the Sun .
50 - foot foot -- 15 18 .
If you look at the solar system .
And of course , there are other things in the solar system .
But we 're talking about the next video .
Then you would look at this point . It 's just a little bit of the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the Sun .
And when we go further and solar from the solar system .
We 're going to see that even more @@UNKNOWN@@ distance is very small .
Or a different perspective .
If the Sun had this size .
If the sun was so big here .
If this point here is the Earth in this size .
Then it would be about 200 feet .
You can imagine a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
If you had a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I make a @@UNKNOWN@@ ...
Then this is the end line .
One @@UNKNOWN@@ , another another .
If you 're doing something in the size of maybe a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
A little bigger than a @@UNKNOWN@@ , a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And this little thing that would 60 60 miles away , which is about 60 .
You 'd like to see him on a @@UNKNOWN@@ !
Something in the size .
Anyway , I @@UNKNOWN@@ it up and hope .
She @@UNKNOWN@@ something that was going to be a little bit of this phenomenon of the Sun .
The Earth , and how far the Earth is from the Sun .
And if we 're going to look at that , we can grow this distance .
Great small , if you think about the rest of the solar system .
And especially if you go beyond the solar system .
Our goal is to make it better .
Now , the user use exactly the answers .
It 's getting faster .
So it 's almost a @@UNKNOWN@@ transition .
With the idea and the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the user .
And we 're looking at the ground .
Google was first on the basis of an algorithm .
Now , I want to follow the Larry Larry and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That 's called the @@UNKNOWN@@ algorithm .
On the basis of this algorithm , they created the two of these two .
One of the new form of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
At that point .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We did n't have it .
For example .
And it was harder .
The content content can find .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
First of Google Google .
For example .
And when we started to make advertising .
That should be so important .
It seems to look like the search search .
And also , I had to give the advertising out of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
To be different .
From the beginning , there was a clear .
@@UNKNOWN@@ and search .
The search result .
Because the user @@UNKNOWN@@ the information .
So , as fast as possible .
@@UNKNOWN@@ search results .
In 1999 and 2000 , we had a search engine .
It 's wonderful .
For pages .
The Google search search .
Then it was better .
It also also the expectations of the user .
They did n't want any pages .
They wanted the best information .
It 's a picture or a book .
So we started , new and others .
In the search .
First of all , the @@UNKNOWN@@ came .
One picture says more than 1,000 words .
Often the question .
Which is @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They gave " @@UNKNOWN@@ " as a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And this question is just possible .
It 's a answer .
After the events .
We were our users from Google .
They were looking for New York City .
And we got it in our results .
@@UNKNOWN@@ the sad sad day .
There was a month ago .
And of course , of course , not the same issue .
That 's how we put on the left on the top of my examples .
It 's on our front front , and our colleagues .
It 's on them .
Because we did n't find the news .
I was with my friend friend .
It was a conference and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
" If we ask news .
And we have different ideas .
The same issue .
Is n't that great ? "
This was the birth of Google News .
Our special @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In 2002 .
@@UNKNOWN@@ and more .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , more videos , content content .
We 've been asked by Google Google .
And she can find everything that 's on the Web .
Anyway , if text , a website or news .
All of it should be central .
So we came up with the idea of the universal search .
You should just look at Google .
But no matter of content .
It is .
A problem with the universal search .
that you can make up with me .
The Web can imagine as well .
It was an image .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ from images .
Let 's look at it .
The size of the image and the number of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Is it black ?
All these signals are just for images .
Not for @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And this is what happened .
It was so hard .
Finally , it ended up .
It 's either on the side , down on the side .
Or somewhere in the center .
There we go .
Not exactly what they could .
especially in different ways .
And over the years .
We 've got a big step further .
Today we show .
different kinds of information .
On the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Because our algorithms are better .
@@UNKNOWN@@ solutions .
We need to look at the user user .
What they wish .
And the results should be very quickly .
Now , the user do n't even notice .
It did n't have a @@UNKNOWN@@ point .
In fact , it did n't start .
It should be .
If you look for a certain information .
So Google Google .
It 's about our @@UNKNOWN@@ .
For example .
They want to be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
How do you know what 's the State State State State ?
We want you to Google .
And so quickly , how do you get the information information .
With Google , you do n't even have to even yet .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They do n't need to go .
You can give it " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
And you see results .
Even before you thought about it .
The future of search .
And we basically have the limits .
The interaction of a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
With the search engine .
With the search of images , the image itself itself .
It 's like @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Our user need today .
@@UNKNOWN@@ answers .
My dream was always to see a star star computer computer .
I think I could .
My computer wonder .
" When I 'm looking at the early @@UNKNOWN@@ of this year .
With the @@UNKNOWN@@ in India ? "
Once we can answer that question .
But that 's not even the case .
They 're going to be answers to answers .
There are more complex questions .
There 's a real @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ questions that when she comes from Google .
We 've got more knowledge .
And they 're going to help them better .
So , welcome to this @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
For @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ the foot around the machine and check .
For some of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the same thing .
They wear a digital camera .
And you know , the clients of their results .
Look at the power and air .
To the machine , and the connections are correct .
@@UNKNOWN@@ of the electric code .
For the electrical service of the machine .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
These documents have shown to the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
size - up for the little computers .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ has to have a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And at least one of the @@UNKNOWN@@ and 13 inches .
It 's all the source of the machine .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ with the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's going to be low - cost @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And the performance of the machine under @@UNKNOWN@@ conditions .
With the power force and air in the place .
Let 's start on the machine machine .
@@UNKNOWN@@ the door of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ all the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ literature .
In the machine machine .
And at that point , you want to organize the option .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , and with the machine .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , check out what you have .
@@UNKNOWN@@ to create this .
@@UNKNOWN@@ them , and they put it in the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's better on the physical control .
It 's called the roof roof .
And you need to be in the right position .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ from five to @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Let 's leave the lower left corner , but you do .
@@UNKNOWN@@ up the top of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And you 're taking it out .
Let 's go down the bottom line .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and the @@UNKNOWN@@ for now .
That @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And you should be interested in the question of someone in questions .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , when the @@UNKNOWN@@ in position .
They 're going to get very carefully .
And you 're sure you 're in a stable position .
In addition to the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ it very slowly .
If you do n't have any wire than the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ with the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It can be @@UNKNOWN@@ during the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's going between the @@UNKNOWN@@ and the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ the rest of other people , and I 'm sure all of them are going to @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ back to the top roof .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ about the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Now , do n't make sure they 're not too @@UNKNOWN@@ .
From the @@UNKNOWN@@ on the machine , you take the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's with a @@UNKNOWN@@ or another guy .
@@UNKNOWN@@ of all sorts of different ways of others .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , with @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in other tasks .
This brings the @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
A plastic plastic can be used to fly down .
It 's very powerful applications of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Do n't use @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ or @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
These @@UNKNOWN@@ are going to make the kind of ways .
Notice that it 's not one of the axis .
It was all @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And it turns out , @@UNKNOWN@@ the way .
@@UNKNOWN@@ with @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ on @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And it @@UNKNOWN@@ down to the bottom .
On the back of the machine .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ of air air was running on the machine .
Look at the air air and the @@UNKNOWN@@ 's correct .
It 's inside the machine that you 're using the @@UNKNOWN@@ on the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ to @@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ with a five - inch .
The chip -- when they go .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ poetry before @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ a little clip of the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ poetry .
And the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Just slow down the sheet .
On the @@UNKNOWN@@ of poetry against the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
While the @@UNKNOWN@@ is @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's a good time to be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's like @@UNKNOWN@@ and work .
It 's on the bottom of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
You 're going to get the little work of @@UNKNOWN@@ through the front - @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , even more long - term , more @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And I 'm going to be able to push the secret @@UNKNOWN@@ on the end of the table .
The back , and check it out .
That 's what makes it makes .
And they 're correct , and they 're @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Let 's use a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Every one of those values for the second thing .
Look at the @@UNKNOWN@@ of stage to the ground .
They 're going to write these values .
It 's not going to be moving on the ground .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ values .
If you have a value that 's probably too high .
There 's a bad or no soil in the ground .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , what you discovered .
If the values are fine .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in the position , and check it .
It 's not an @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's just the @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ version of the average number .
Think about the @@UNKNOWN@@ and imagine the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ the line of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So now they 're using the machine .
And it 's moving on the @@UNKNOWN@@ and you open up power .
It 's on the back of the machine to prove it .
@@UNKNOWN@@ from clients - @@UNKNOWN@@ services .
At the stage with the @@UNKNOWN@@ machine .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , whether it 's moving .
A red light shows that the performance is @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Let 's take the clients to get the energy on the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And @@UNKNOWN@@ day , or Mark @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Nobody did it .
They make sure that twice the number of lines .
To make sure that there 's no skin there .
@@UNKNOWN@@ the lines of lines lines and @@UNKNOWN@@ in the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
After the machine , @@UNKNOWN@@ up and control control .
It 's @@UNKNOWN@@ , you 're going to @@UNKNOWN@@ the machine 's screen screen .
@@UNKNOWN@@ the number of the computer .
@@UNKNOWN@@ software .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The key key code is using it on .
@@UNKNOWN@@ - @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ them on the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ the machine .
If the information comes out .
They get the key code for the engine of the machine .
Give me the key code and you write .
The machine is going to work .
@@UNKNOWN@@ with @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's ready to stop .
@@UNKNOWN@@ all the signs of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ all @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Do n't get the machine with nothing more to @@UNKNOWN@@ from the clients .
@@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ between the head head and the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I 'm going to play the clip , the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ on the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Now this is the @@UNKNOWN@@ axis .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , you do zero .
For example , this is moving up to the top .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's going out of the machine .
The machine in our @@UNKNOWN@@ example has used the @@UNKNOWN@@ option .
And in this case , the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
For the @@UNKNOWN@@ tool .
Now we 're going to start the machine using the three things .
First of all , the machine @@UNKNOWN@@ on the right level of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Second , the machine is @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And finally , every @@UNKNOWN@@ or @@UNKNOWN@@ in the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's going to be able to fly the machine .
The level is @@UNKNOWN@@ in the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In a @@UNKNOWN@@ video in @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And with the engine of geometry .
@@UNKNOWN@@ up the program .
Take the @@UNKNOWN@@ program , and you choose the @@UNKNOWN@@ memory .
Look at @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And you choose to choose .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and the @@UNKNOWN@@ is going to be done at 500 feet .
I want to talk to the clients that the good thing to do this program is the first thing that morning .
And if the computers were more than a few days .
@@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And that 's the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Now it 's a good time to @@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ and the components of components .
@@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ on the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ is necessary .
@@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ them , and you @@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In the @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ for the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Let 's see if it 's right now .
@@UNKNOWN@@ .
And all of the key lines on the current side .
@@UNKNOWN@@ makes sure it 's also good .
@@UNKNOWN@@ the next between the machine .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ line of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ for the norm .
@@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ from the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in the box .
If the machine with a @@UNKNOWN@@ option .
@@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ with the high - ray of the engine .
@@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ for @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
If you put the @@UNKNOWN@@ down on the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And you connect the @@UNKNOWN@@ with the @@UNKNOWN@@ point on the phone .
When the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ are @@UNKNOWN@@ .
You 're going to ask you with the clients .
That was the connections that were just done .
You can look at @@UNKNOWN@@ .
While you 're waiting to be the clients of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's a good point of time again , again , again , again , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ for the structure .
Look at the @@UNKNOWN@@ and compare this with your number numbers .
@@UNKNOWN@@ should n't be more than @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Five percent of the @@UNKNOWN@@ are our values values that were broken .
If you do n't want to focus , you want to know the clients .
You can have some reason to worry .
In this @@UNKNOWN@@ example of the three lines .
And three feet on the ground values are @@UNKNOWN@@ .
If the @@UNKNOWN@@ is full , you 're all part of the system .
And to check that no of the connections .
Do n't use the computer program to build the best options for this machine .
And you 're going to @@UNKNOWN@@ all of these .
And each option for @@UNKNOWN@@ function .
It 's done with the opportunity to get the @@UNKNOWN@@ program .
This is an @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And the machine is @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Thank you just to look at this report of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I 'm going to tell you something about the last 30 years .
That 's quite a lot of 18 minutes .
It 's a complex issue , so we start directly on a complex place : New Zealand .
Because , 30 years ago , I grew up with six years ago with my parents in New Zealand in a city called @@UNKNOWN@@ , and that was my @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In the middle of my @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , which I had with my sister .
In my toy and the @@UNKNOWN@@ , it was a crazy with a living room .
There was all of the eyes , and looked at all of me , and I looked at every time , and when I was going to go from the library in the room , and then when I was
And I looked like this .
I was @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I lost this gang , which I was @@UNKNOWN@@ this room and this house .
And this is architecture .
This feeling , my emotions emotions , which is the power of architecture , because in architecture , it 's not about mathematics and @@UNKNOWN@@ , it 's about the deep , emotional connections that we have in places where
And it does n't feel that we feel like it 's because the [ ] ] @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ Americans are 90 percent of their time .
So we are 90 percent of our time from architecture .
This is enormous .
It means that architecture is a way that we do n't realize .
That makes us a little bit of smart and very @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And if I 'm going to show you a building building , I know what you think you think about " power , " stability , " democracy . "
And you think that because it 's a building , which happened to two million years ago of the Greeks .
This is a trick .
So this kind of architect , architects , to create emotional connections to make the shapes that we build our buildings .
It 's an emotional emotional connection , and we use this trick very long .
We follow the trick out of 200 years ago at the building .
We @@UNKNOWN@@ him in the 19th century .
In America , 20 years ago , we built it .
So look at these very , very small soldiers on the ocean , and look at the ocean and look at the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That 's very useful , because things are building .
It 's expensive ; it takes very complicated .
People who build things -- and governments -- governments and governments -- and , of course , of course innovation innovation , they 're going to use the shapes , the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That leads to buildings like this .
This is a beautiful building .
But it does n't have a lot of what to do a library today .
In the same year , 2004 , on the other side of the United States , there was a number of library , and it looks like this .
This is in Seattle .
In the library , it 's about the media in the digital age .
It 's about a new way of public services for the city , a place for @@UNKNOWN@@ , to read and for exchange .
How is it possible that in the same year in the same country , two buildings , both @@UNKNOWN@@ , are so different .
architecture is based on a kind of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
On the one hand , the innovation , architects are constantly changing new technologies , new technologies , new solutions for the way we live today .
We 're all going to be black , you 'll be very depressed . They 're like us , but we 're dead , because we have no choice .
We need to change the side and the symbols again , which you love .
If we do that , and you 're happy , we feel like @@UNKNOWN@@ , so we 're doing this , and we 're going to @@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ and back , all over the last 300 years , and
30 years ago , about the end of the 1970s .
@@UNKNOWN@@ architects are called " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
And it went to concrete .
Small windows , @@UNKNOWN@@ scale .
That 's really hard stuff .
When we started the ' 80s , we started to see these symbols @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We @@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ back to the other direction .
We took the shapes that you like , and @@UNKNOWN@@ them .
We put together and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and some new material .
And you loved it .
They did n't get enough of them .
We took @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and they were able to grow them in high - @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The shapes were big , @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ were @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It was crazy .
But these were the ' 80s , which was cool .
So this was the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So it was with symbols .
They were just cheap and cheap , because instead of places , we created memories of places .
I know , and I know you all know that 's not the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This is @@UNKNOWN@@ .
At the end of the 80s and the beginning of the 90s , we called it " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
We made the historical symbols behind us back , and we came up with new , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and new new shapes , the forms of different shapes .
This was @@UNKNOWN@@ and exciting , so this was very @@UNKNOWN@@ , we @@UNKNOWN@@ it all .
It would normally go back again .
But then something happened .
In fact , this building opened up .
This is the @@UNKNOWN@@ of Frank Frank .
This building changed the relationship of the world to architecture .
So Paul @@UNKNOWN@@ was this photograph of one of those moments moments in the academic , the @@UNKNOWN@@ and the public at the building that we had was a opinion .
The New York Times called this building a miracle .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ grew up in @@UNKNOWN@@ and two 500 percent after the building was built .
He 's our first @@UNKNOWN@@ .
How is it possible that these shapes -- @@UNKNOWN@@ and radically -- how is it possible to spread around the world ?
This happened because the media was successful , and then we quickly quickly @@UNKNOWN@@ that these shapes culture and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
These shapes call us an emotional response .
Just like in the world world .
Everybody 's knew that these shapes and culture were @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This phenomenon of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ also some other @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Think about your @@UNKNOWN@@ .
A thousand years ago , you have to go to the village village to see a building .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ : You take a boat , an airplane , you drive as an airplane .
The technology @@UNKNOWN@@ : You see it in newspapers , in the TV , until we finally all @@UNKNOWN@@ , and the @@UNKNOWN@@ from the site .
Now , architecture is everywhere everywhere , which is that the speed of the technology finally have the speed of architecture .
Because architecture is pretty fast .
It does n't happen for a building .
But it takes long to build a building , three to four years , and in the process of an architect , two or a half , two or a half different buildings , before he knows whether the building
That 's the lack of a good feedback in the architecture .
That 's why we have these buildings .
This is never going to happen again , I think , because we 're very short before the largest revolution in the architecture since the invention of @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ or the @@UNKNOWN@@ , it 's a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I 'm going to see the theory of my theory , and it 's faster faster , when you 're media media , until it seems to be in the same time , both of all of the things that
Now , we can almost almost close to the position of some symbols of some kind of different .
That 's going to work on a project that we 've learned recently .
We were @@UNKNOWN@@ to create this building building .
This is the center of a city called @@UNKNOWN@@ on Island Island in New York .
It 's a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We started a @@UNKNOWN@@ building that all of us in the common form . We were worried , our clients and the community was also worried , so we did a series of @@UNKNOWN@@ that we 're on Facebook and
That meant that it was two years ago , a part of the community was there , which was the most interesting thing that I was looking at .
The building was already a part of this community , and in the first summer , when people started and began to build the buildings into the social media , it was not a building building , but it was
So we do n't need a Greeks that we tell us what we think about architecture .
We can tell each other , which we think about architecture , because the digital media have not only the relationship between us , they have the relationship between us and buildings .
Think about the moment in @@UNKNOWN@@ .
If the building is going to be built , it would be next as first online and new new media .
They would be @@UNKNOWN@@ with innovative , innovative examples , which is the border that you can see .
This is @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That 's the company that they get to the mayor and to the citizens of @@UNKNOWN@@ , to tell them , there 's not just a answer to what is a library today .
Be a part of that .
This @@UNKNOWN@@ of experiments that have the freedom to do their own experiment .
Everything has changed .
Now , architects are not a collective creatures , the great words and complicated structures , and you do n't have the public public -- the consumer , which is not missing , which is not seen .
architects can hear it , and architecture @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That 's the end of the @@UNKNOWN@@ . That means that the future buildings are going to be different differently than the current buildings .
It means that a public room in the ancient history of @@UNKNOWN@@ in a unique way , and the @@UNKNOWN@@ of a modern city .
A @@UNKNOWN@@ in Brooklyn can be a @@UNKNOWN@@ in Brooklyn , and not some of the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ from our ideas from a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The robots are going to build our buildings , because we finally get to the form that they make .
It 's going to be @@UNKNOWN@@ after nature .
It 's a place in Chile , Florida , Florida , which can also be a place where you can work , and you can do it , and you can do it too late at the end of the
It does n't mean that it 's not a little bit of innovation , like this little @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is just like @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ as the animal that he designed designed .
So , a building does n't have to be beautiful , to be @@UNKNOWN@@ , like this ugly little building in Spain , where the architects had a hole , @@UNKNOWN@@ with @@UNKNOWN@@ , and concrete was @@UNKNOWN@@ , and
It does n't matter whether a cow does our buildings , or a robot building our buildings .
It 's not what we 're building , it 's just important what we 're building .
Now , architects like , " You know , " @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ building .
We were just waiting for you to do it .
Finally , we do n't have more on @@UNKNOWN@@ pages .
If you think of a architects , you 're going to create a architects , design with a better building , better cities and a better world , because it 's a lot of the game .
In fact , it does n't just like our society again , and they form them back to the smallest places : the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the home , where you get your children , and the way that they take
Thank you .
That 's my brother , @@UNKNOWN@@ .
She started a year ago and started starting .
She goes to this cool way , like @@UNKNOWN@@ now , a @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is my body to be fast for my legs .
It looks pretty cute .
And one of them is @@UNKNOWN@@ , and even in the mirror .
She love her mirror .
They @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , and there are even the great ones , @@UNKNOWN@@
When it 's not going to be more fine , should be @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
Because obviously , we do n't .
Every month , @@UNKNOWN@@ people in Google : " Am I ugly ? "
This is @@UNKNOWN@@ . @@UNKNOWN@@ is 13 and lives in New York .
And as a teenager , she just wanted to love and play .
It 's a little bit more about it . She 's a little bit more than your mother told her , and she 's going to say that she 's nice to tell you every day every day in school
Because her mother does a saying , and their friends or a little bit of other things , they do n't know what they believe .
Some of them are something that you should think about it .
This is an average , healthy @@UNKNOWN@@ girl , who has this feedback in an emotional response to her life .
Well , the teenagers are today alone .
They 're under pressure , online online and available online , they 're talking , news news , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , " -- it does n't hear .
Never before we were so connected , so @@UNKNOWN@@ , so young .
A mother said to me , when it 's a party in the room .
You do n't have a personal personal life .
And the social deal with this is @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This is -- I think of course teach children who are self - based on the basis of " @@UNKNOWN@@ , " and the kind of the comments that they 're able to do .
There 's no distance between the online and " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
What 's real , and what 's not really hard to say .
Which is their source of inspiration ?
You can see the images in the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the world today .
If you can count the amount of money , still the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ is today .
And trends like @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
By the way , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ is @@UNKNOWN@@ .
These trends go up with the @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of women .
In culture today , you can see how to describe the girl .
But the boys are also not immune .
The pursuit after the face of the face and the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But where is the problem ?
In fact , we want our children to healthy children , healthy people .
But in a view of the culture of our culture , we teach our children to spend more time and thoughts with the look at the cost of all other aspects of their identity .
The start of their relationships , physical development , and the high school , too .
Six of 10 girls do n't do it because they think they 're not good enough .
And that 's not @@UNKNOWN@@ activities .
It 's fundamental activities in their development as a human and as an @@UNKNOWN@@ and society .
Twenty - five percent , about a half - a - year - a - time talk to a debate in the classroom . They do n't talk about it because they 're not paying attention to their teeth .
One of five percent is not at school when they do n't feel it .
If you think of what you 're thinking about , you do n't look good at all , and it 's not enough enough , you 're going to go down on average , you do n't hear a sound
And that 's everywhere .
And China , and very much , how much you actually do it .
In order to make it clear , it 's about how you think it looks like , and not how you actually do it .
It looks like @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But it also also the health .
@@UNKNOWN@@ with @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ do less exercise , eating less plants and vegetables , more likely to increase the weight , which is @@UNKNOWN@@ , and to eat food .
And it does n't change .
Women , they think that they are thick , and again , right now , whether they 're or they 're not higher .
17 percent of women do n't go to a job interview job when they were looking at their day with their look .
Think about what it does with the economy .
If we were able to overcome this , the possibility that we open up .
Now , this potential potential to be interested in every single person .
But how do we do that ?
Just do n't tell you very much .
It 's not enough .
If we want to move what we need to do .
Here 's three key : First , we need to teach them more self - esteem .
We need to help our kids to develop strategies to go back to the image of @@UNKNOWN@@ and the @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The good news is that there are lots of programs .
But the bad news is that most of them do n't work .
I was shocked to know that well - @@UNKNOWN@@ programs have changed the situation .
We really have to make sure that the programs that we do with our children are not just a positive , but they have an @@UNKNOWN@@ effect .
The research shows that the best programs are six - year - old people , which is the first thing of the family , friends and relationships .
Second , the media and the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and the way we deal with @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ , how we interact with others , and we 're going to look at the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That 's what I 'm going to talk about women women and how to talk about it .
It 's not okay that we 're going to increase the amount of our @@UNKNOWN@@ because of their @@UNKNOWN@@ , the size of their @@UNKNOWN@@ , or to the success , a success of their view .
We need to start with them , and instead of what they look like .
We can all start , responsibility for the images and comments that we call in the social networks .
We can ask people to their @@UNKNOWN@@ and their do , and not for their look , they do .
And I wonder , when do you have a mirror mirror ?
We need to work like communities , governments and work together to create a little bit more , so our children have to build their self - esteem , and diversity and diversity .
We need to make people who really want to move a little bit of @@UNKNOWN@@ , so they make something in the world .
We have to leave the stage , because it 's changing the world .
A world where our children have the freedom to be the best version of their self .
Think about what this person can do in your life .
A friend ? Or the woman who only do something else .
What would it mean for them , if they were from this voice , their inner body would be @@UNKNOWN@@ , the their @@UNKNOWN@@ , their legs , @@UNKNOWN@@ legs , a little broken , or smaller , or smaller
What would it mean for them , if we do this , and so their potential ?
Today , all of us are obsessed with the culture of our culture .
Let 's tell our kids .
So let 's show you that the look just a part of our identity , and we 're actually love that for what they 're doing , and what they give us for us .
@@UNKNOWN@@ needs to the curriculum .
Every one of us should talk about the way we 're talking about and others with others .
And we work together as communities together , from the @@UNKNOWN@@ to the government , so that the happy @@UNKNOWN@@ of today is the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of tomorrow .
Let 's go .
On five five , I was a guy named El - @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in a hotel in Manhattan and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ on @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , who was @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ was first from the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , but while he took his life on the same thing , and he was different men and other men , @@UNKNOWN@@ on a dozen New York City , including
For happiness , these plans of a FBI @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Unfortunately , the @@UNKNOWN@@ on the World Center Center was not @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I was in @@UNKNOWN@@ in Oxford , December , as a son of an artist @@UNKNOWN@@ and an American American and @@UNKNOWN@@ , who were born their best to give me a happy childhood .
It was when I was seven years old when the world started changing .
My dad told me one side of Islam , and a few people , including the majority of Muslims , to see .
But yet , in every religion , in every single person , a little bit of people who are so @@UNKNOWN@@ in their faith , they believe they should have to make it in their power to make other people
We came up with @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , who did n't get our knowledge from the FBI .
At the day I met my last five and a little light on the top of the light , and the surprise of all , especially my day , the entire goal in fire .
This one seems that she seemed very hard to think of it , but I realized just a few years later , what they were actually so funny .
They thought I had the same @@UNKNOWN@@ like my dad .
These men have been @@UNKNOWN@@ for a @@UNKNOWN@@ with @@UNKNOWN@@ pounds on a bottom of the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I was looking at that men .
These men call it " @@UNKNOWN@@ , " which means so much like the uncle .
When I was a @@UNKNOWN@@ , we 've been growing up , and I saw these @@UNKNOWN@@ in my childhood , I had a chance to find friends .
And as soon as I felt somewhere a little bit of a time , it was time to make the @@UNKNOWN@@ and put the next city .
And I 've been used to the new part of the class , and I was often the victim of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So I spent most of my time at the time , and I read books , watching TV or video games .
That 's why I was worried about @@UNKNOWN@@ skills -- to make it more powerful -- and then I grew up in a @@UNKNOWN@@ house , I was n't prepared to the real world .
I 've been making sure that people are going to increase in terms of terms , like , for example , or their religion .
So , I opened up the eyes ?
One of my first experiences that I think of thinking , I was doing 2000 as the election .
When I was going to go to college college , I could go to the National @@UNKNOWN@@ in @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ of my group was @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I was almost almost my entire life of @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ this issue with emotions .
The members of our group came from different social layers .
On the day day , I found that I had a boy that I had @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It took some days to go to this little bit of light , and I realized that there was no natural @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And here I met people in all of the cultures and cultures , and the experience of my own desire .
I feel like that I was able to change the philosophy that were taught me as a child who were born with real real life .
I do n't know how it 's gay to be gay , but I know very good , as it is , for something that 's going to control my control .
Then there was " The show . "
For me , of course , a lot of unexpected ways , and the fact that a king of the world is more likely to be more positive than my @@UNKNOWN@@ father , which is not at me .
One day I had a conversation with my mother 's thinking about how my world started changing , and I told them something that I was going to live in my heart .
She looked at me with the eyes of a woman who had her life on the entire life , and I said , " I 'm sorry to hate people . "
At that moment , I realized how much more energy energy , it takes to hate that hate .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ is not my real name .
I changed it as my family decided to touch with my father and a new life .
So why do I call myself and I 'm going to be able to stand in danger ?
It 's very simple .
Instead , I use my experiences , against terrorism , against the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I 'm doing it for the victims of terrorism , and their @@UNKNOWN@@ , for the terrible pain and loss that they have in their lives in their lives .
For the victims of the terrorism , I 'm talking against these kinds of action , and @@UNKNOWN@@ the action of my dad .
And in this particular fact , I 'm the living evidence of evidence that violence is not in a religion or @@UNKNOWN@@ , and that the son does n't have to come in the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the father .
I 'm not my dad .
In this moment , a movie in your head .
It 's a nice , @@UNKNOWN@@ movie .
He 's 3D with @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ for all of what you 're just seeing , but this is just the beginning .
Your film has smell , taste and touch .
He has a sense of your body , pain , hunger , hunger .
He has emotions , feeling and joy .
He has memories , for example , moments of the childhood , so that you can play with you .
And he 's got a @@UNKNOWN@@ program .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ in the movie can play , and you can see all the right .
The movie is your power of consciousness , the result of how you see your mind and the world .
The consciousness is one of the fundamental elements of human life .
Everyone from us .
We all have our own virtual , you and you and you .
There 's nothing we 've seen .
At least , I have changed my mind .
I ca n't argue that you 're aware .
Our mind is also what makes life life .
If we did n't realize , it had nothing in our life and meaning .
At the same time , the phenomenon phenomenon of the universe .
Why do n't we just robots robots , all of the data , and all of you have to take the @@UNKNOWN@@ , without this virtual movie ?
At that point , nobody does n't get answers to these questions .
I 'm going to argue that some radical ideas are going to be going to be able to go to the area of the discovery of progress .
Some of them say a science of consciousness is impossible .
The science is nature .
The consciousness is nature .
So it can never be a science of consciousness .
For the most of the 20th century , the opinion of this idea .
Now , the study looked at the behavior of @@UNKNOWN@@ , who studied the brain of the brain , and nobody has changed the consciousness .
Now , about 30 years ago , when TED came in the field of the discovery of a little scientific work .
About 20 years ago .
So , like @@UNKNOWN@@ , Feynman and physicists like @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , who have been thinking that the science also has to control the mind .
In that point , there was a real explosion . The science of consciousness began to rise .
This work is great . It 's great .
But she also has some of the limits .
A part of this work that we 've just seen from @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , when they created their wonderful work .
So now , we understand a lot better , which changes with the awareness of their faces , or with the feeling of pain or joy .
But this is still science science .
It 's not science .
We know that these brain interact with certain species of consciousness , but we do n't know why they do .
I see that this kind of evidence of what 's going to have some questions about the minds that we 're looking for -- the question , what particular neurons do , and what they do .
But in a way , this is the simple problems .
Nothing against @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , there are no simple problems .
But that does n't solve the true puzzles , the essence of this subject : Why are all the physical processes of the brain at the brain ?
Why does this mean , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
So yet , there is no answer to this question .
Now you might think that should be just a few years ago .
It 's going to be a more @@UNKNOWN@@ phenomenon , like @@UNKNOWN@@ , like @@UNKNOWN@@ , like life , and we 'll explain it .
The classic problems of the rise of all of the evolution of behavior : how @@UNKNOWN@@ are like , how do they work , how to live a living organism , @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ , all the questions ?
You could use this to the human brain , by using behaviors and behaviors of the brain brain as a phenomenon phenomenon , how we talk about how we talk about play , all the questions of behavior .
But if it 's about consciousness , they want to ask questions about the simplest problems .
If it 's complicated complicated , it 's the question of why , all of these behaviors of a collective experience .
In fact , the standard model of evolution , even though the standard model of neuroscience , not too much too .
What science is , I 'm in a heart heart .
I want to say a scientific theory of consciousness , which works . For a long time , I 've been looking at a theory of consciousness , which is completely physical @@UNKNOWN@@ , and it works on @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But I had to realize that this could n't work for many reasons .
So I believe that we 're on a kind of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We 've got this wonderful , great chain of reasons , so it 's mostly because of the physics of the chemistry , the chemistry of biology , biology and biology can be parts of the psychology .
But the mind does n't seem to be in this model .
On the one hand , we 're aware .
On the other hand , we do n't know how to do this in our scientific world .
So I think that the conscious mind is a kind of stress that we need to see in our world , but we do n't know exactly .
@@UNKNOWN@@ with such an enemy , radical ideas would be , and I think we could be able to do something or two ideas that are going to be crazy , before we 're going to understand the idea of
There are a couple of people who come to these crazy ideas .
My friend Dan Dan , who today today , has one of these ideas .
He means that it 's no hard problem with consciousness .
The whole idea of the inner - @@UNKNOWN@@ film is based on a kind of illusion .
In fact , we need to only use the function of the brain of the brain , and then we have to explain what to explain .
I say that .
This is the kind of radical ideas that we need to study if we 're going to @@UNKNOWN@@ a @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ theory of consciousness .
But this idea for me , and many other @@UNKNOWN@@ , because it 's the existence of human consciousness .
So I go to another direction .
In the last time I 'd like to go to two crazy ideas that I think they could be .
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is conscious .
And we can see some of the things as the fundamental structure : space , time and mass .
They ask the laws of laws that are based on them , how the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics .
These fundamental properties and laws are not going to explain anything yet .
They 're going to see more than @@UNKNOWN@@ , and on their basis , the world is built .
Sometimes it 's going to get the list of the fundamental things .
In the 19th century , we found out that you can find the phenomenon of the lack of scientific fundamental things , the space , time , mass of gravity , so he wrote the laws of nature , and
I think we 're in the same situation .
If you do n't understand any of the elements that you ca n't explain -- space , time , mass , @@UNKNOWN@@ -- that 's the wrong thing that you have to have the list .
The natural consequence would be aware of consciousness as an important element to explain to a fundamental structure of nature .
That does n't mean that you ca n't have science .
It opens the way to science science .
So , what we need to have to understand is that we can understand the laws of what the minds of consciousness , with the other part of the elements of the space , space , time , mass ,
And say , sometimes sometimes we need fundamental laws that are so simple that you can put them on the front of a shirt shirt .
I think we 're with the minds in such a situation .
We want to understand some laws that are so simple that you can put them on a shirt shirt .
We do n't know what the laws are , but we 're working on it .
The second crazy idea is that the consciousness should be universal .
Every system could have a certain kind of mind .
So this view is sometimes as @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , " He says , " @@UNKNOWN@@ " for mind , every system , but it 's not just human beings , mice , flies , flies , but even at the
Even every one has a certain amount of consciousness .
This approach does n't say that smart smart are smart or thinking .
It 's not an @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I think , " Ah , I 'm moving up with the light light .
I can never stop and I 'll make a lot . "
No , no .
But the idea is that it might be a certain kind of @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ feeling , a kind of primitive @@UNKNOWN@@ of consciousness .
This may be a little bit sound like this .
I mean , why should someone do something like that ?
And part of that , in the first crazy idea , that consciousness is conscious .
If it 's fundamental , like space , time and mass , so we can also be able to think of it as well as they are .
You also have to say that this idea that makes us seem to be @@UNKNOWN@@ , for other people , but we 're less less @@UNKNOWN@@ , in cultures , the human mind in terms of nature .
One of the motivation comes from the idea that maybe the simplest and the best way to understand the fundamental laws of consciousness and physical @@UNKNOWN@@ , in order to be able to connect with information .
Where 's always there , there 's consciousness .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , like humans .
Simple @@UNKNOWN@@ -- simple .
@@UNKNOWN@@ is that in the last few years ago , a @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , the approach of this theory has developed a mathematical theory .
He does n't look at the most of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is called " @@UNKNOWN@@ " to measure the system in a system .
And he said that @@UNKNOWN@@ with consciousness .
So , in the brain brain , a huge amount of @@UNKNOWN@@ , a high level of @@UNKNOWN@@ , a lot of consciousness .
In a mouse , a large amount of @@UNKNOWN@@ , still very high -- @@UNKNOWN@@ levels of consciousness .
But if we go further down to the microbes , particles , particles .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , but still bigger than zero .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ theory , and it 's still going to be aware of consciousness , which is zero zero .
In fact , he 's going to understand a fundamental law of consciousness .
I do n't know if this theory is right , but it might be the @@UNKNOWN@@ theory of science of consciousness , and she @@UNKNOWN@@ the whole story of data .
Another example is that it could help us to help the consciousness into the physical world .
@@UNKNOWN@@ and physicists have @@UNKNOWN@@ that the physics is abstract .
It tells the structure of reality with a series of different , but it does n't tell us about reality .
How about Stephen @@UNKNOWN@@ says , " What @@UNKNOWN@@ the Life lives ? "
After the point of view , you can control the physics of physics , as they are , but you can use them to use the power of consciousness .
That 's what the physics does all do , the power of consciousness .
So , this is the consciousness that the life 's life of life .
For this view of consciousness , you do n't look outside of the physical world as a kind of choice .
It 's exactly in your center .
I think this @@UNKNOWN@@ view has the potential to change our relationship with nature , and that might be some serious social and ethical consequences .
Some of them do n't like that .
I thought I should n't eat anything that has a mind , and that 's why .
If you look at the @@UNKNOWN@@ view , you 'll be very hungry .
I think if you think about it , it would change the way that we think about it , which is what looks like moral and moral perspective is less less than the consciousness of consciousness , but it 's
It 's also obvious to think of consciousness in other systems , like , for example , computers .
What about the artificial artificial system in the film , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , " ?
Is it conscious ?
If you have the @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ view , it 's certainly a high level of @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ . So the answer is yes .
If that 's right , it 's serious serious issues on both of these things , and more useful than the @@UNKNOWN@@ of their @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And finally , you could go to all the minds , the groups , the planet .
Did Canada have a mind ?
Or on a level level , a group group , like the audience of a TED conference , we just have a collective TED mind -- there 's a virtual film for the collective TED group of the @@UNKNOWN@@ of
I know the answer to this question , but I think they should be at least .
Okay , this vision of @@UNKNOWN@@ is radically , and I do n't know whether it 's right .
I 'm actually more powerful from the first crazy idea that the consciousness is conscious than the second thing that it is .
Now , this view shows a lot of questions , a lot of challenges , for example , like the individual parts of consciousness and the complexity of consciousness that we know and love .
If we find answers , we 're on the right way to get a serious theory of consciousness .
If not , that 's the most complex problem in science and philosophy .
We can not expect to do it at night .
But I believe we 're going to solve it .
I think the understanding of our consciousness is both a key to understand the universe as the understanding of us .
It takes just the crazy idea .
Thank you very much .
I grew up in a very small town in @@UNKNOWN@@ .
My childhood was normal .
I went to school , with my friends , @@UNKNOWN@@ me with my younger sister .
It was all normal .
When I was 15 , I was talking to the father of my parents : the community wanted to give me a leader for a special service .
My parents said , " Well , this is really nice , but there 's a problem problem .
In order to be honest , she did n't have anything yet . " And they were right .
I went to school , and I got a lot of notes , and after a high school , a little bit in the @@UNKNOWN@@ of my mother , and I spent a lot of time , " @@UNKNOWN@@ --
Yeah , I know .
But they were right .
And later , during my @@UNKNOWN@@ in a high school in high school , so after 20 years later in the @@UNKNOWN@@ , a boy and asked , " When do you start with your talk ? "
" What happened ? "
I had 20 minutes talking about @@UNKNOWN@@ and bad @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He said , " You know , well , your @@UNKNOWN@@ .
If someone told me in the wheelchair @@UNKNOWN@@ , this person is mostly @@UNKNOWN@@ stuff . "
" normally normally find it in the @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
And I was a light on this : that boy had a lot of people who have been thinking so far as a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
For him , we can do that , and it ca n't happen anything .
For many of them , not teachers , doctors or @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We 're not real people . We should be inspired .
And in fact , I 'm sitting here on this stage and see how I 'm in the wheelchair now , and I 'm going to expect that I 'm going to @@UNKNOWN@@ you right ? Right ? Yeah .
Ladies and gentlemen , I do n't have to be terrible .
I 'm not here to inspire you .
I 'm going to tell you that we were @@UNKNOWN@@ when it 's going to happen .
It 's not bad , and it makes us not extraordinary .
In the last few years , we found that lie in the social media even more .
They 've probably seen images like this , " The only potential in life is a bad mind . "
Or , " Do you 're sorry . "
Or , "
These are just a few examples . It has a lot of these images .
You may recognize this from the little girl without my hands with the pencil in the mouth .
You may have seen that kid on the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And these images , there are a lot that we call @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I use the word @@UNKNOWN@@ , because here 's how to make people with objects that other benefit .
You make objects objects that can be able to benefit .
These images have the purpose to inspire , to help us , and look at the @@UNKNOWN@@ and thinking , " How bad my life , it might be worse .
I could be this person . "
But what if you are this person ?
And I stopped stopped how many people told me to tell me that they were told me , or inspiring .
In a way , you know , I 'm going to stand up with me and I remember my name .
All of these images make objects objects objects for the good of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ are looking at it , so you can look at it , and you can feel better , and it 's worried .
Life can be incredibly difficult .
We do so much .
But what we do is not what you do .
It has nothing to do with our body .
And I do with purpose to the term , because I believe the social model of us , we 're more vulnerable than the society we live in our lives , and through our bodies .
I 've been alive in this body .
I like him .
He does what I need to do , and I learned to have its ability to use their ability to use , just like you , so it 's also with the kids on these photos .
You do n't do anything .
They just use their body , so good it can happen .
Is it really fair to make them objects and how are these photos ?
If people say , " You 're an inspiration , " they want to make a look .
I know why .
Because of the lie that we 've been @@UNKNOWN@@ is that it 's extraordinary .
I 'm thinking about inspiration , and you think , " human , @@UNKNOWN@@ , inspired you never ? "
But , yeah .
I 'm learning about others .
But I do n't even know that I was lucky .
I 'm learning that it 's a great idea , with a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of things . I 'm going to make the magic trick , the phone with the battery of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ !
We learn from the strength and resilience of the other , not in the fight against our body , and against a world that makes us special special objects .
In my mind , I lie to lie about a @@UNKNOWN@@ of corruption .
It makes us a life .
And this quote , " The only thing in life is a bad mind , " It 's not great because it 's not true because of the social model .
You can go through the staircase long , it does n't even turn into a wheel .
That will never happen .
I want to live in a world where life is the norm .
In the girl , a girl girl , in her room , " @@UNKNOWN@@ -- in the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , " is not like @@UNKNOWN@@ , because it 's in the room .
So I want to live in a world where you do n't expect that much of life that you 're going to remember and to remember the name of her name in their name .
So I want to live in a world , in the actual performance of @@UNKNOWN@@ , but I want to live in a world where a student of 11 students were not going to ask you that his new teacher
We do n't think about it , but the @@UNKNOWN@@ of our minds .
Thank you .
What have the " reality reality " and professional @@UNKNOWN@@ with empathy ?
How fast is a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in the air ?
Unfortunately , I 'm just going to answer one of these questions , but you 're not going to fight .
Most people think about reality reality , " @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ " and Tom @@UNKNOWN@@ , as he @@UNKNOWN@@ in the air , but @@UNKNOWN@@ is not science fiction .
@@UNKNOWN@@ is something that faster than we think we 're going to go back to our lives , and it 's going to be because we have to have the technologies that we have to be aware of it ,
And how do we get the @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
The first step I 'm going to do is the first step , Google .
Many of you know about Google @@UNKNOWN@@ .
You may not know that Google is a device that allows you to see what I see .
And to experience how it is , when you 're on the field .
At the moment , you can only experience that when I describe it .
I have to do it in words .
I have to create a platform that you do with your imagination .
In Google , we can put this under a ship , and a sense of how it is , with a little bit about things that have to go through the field , and your heart @@UNKNOWN@@ around the body
You can see how it is , if you 're a @@UNKNOWN@@ man on you , and you 're @@UNKNOWN@@ to @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I 've experienced this , and it does n't feel good .
Here 's the video .
Go .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I 'm going to get closer .
Are you ready ?
Go !
They have sure that people are missing : the rest of the team .
We have a video from the University of Washington .
@@UNKNOWN@@ : Hey , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , eight !
Oh !
@@UNKNOWN@@ want to experience this experience .
You want to go to the field .
You want to be your @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I 'm just talking about YouTube and on Twitter Twitter , " Can you give you a @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
When we have the experience , with @@UNKNOWN@@ and Google , how do we make it better ?
What 's the next step ?
The @@UNKNOWN@@ skull is when one of the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of all the times , and that 's not just a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And I can show you with this video , why this is .
Oh ! Oh !
No ! No !
Oh my God ! @@UNKNOWN@@ !
So this is a man and @@UNKNOWN@@ to be alive .
How is it going to be him when he was going to be able to go through 100 miles an hour ?
I believe , adults are going to get back .
But this is not @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's just virtual reality .
How do we come to the @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
We 're going to do that , when @@UNKNOWN@@ , managers and open these information , and you ask , " How do we improve our team ?
How can we win the game ? "
@@UNKNOWN@@ use technologies to make games .
They want to win , that makes money .
A short story of technologies in the process .
In fact , the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ her @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ with the @@UNKNOWN@@ faster .
They won the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Some of the team also .
More people looked at it .
It was exciting and faster .
In @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , later , the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
More people looked at the games .
and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Imagine if you play . You go back to the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and you can see the next @@UNKNOWN@@ in front of your @@UNKNOWN@@ , which you also have to do today .
I 'm afraid of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Not a lot of all of the lines of learning .
They go out and respond .
And the parents want to do that because you do n't pay instructions , and you do n't lose .
Then they 'll be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They do n't want it .
But @@UNKNOWN@@ is not just a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ allows you to do all of this data in real time , and you can make it better .
How about that ?
It 's a very simple way of a camera in every corner of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is all the @@UNKNOWN@@ down from the eye view .
They also have the data from the @@UNKNOWN@@ and the @@UNKNOWN@@ , technologies that are working on .
They 're all looking at this data for your players .
The good team use data data .
The bad people do it .
This is a good good and bad team .
And now , you know , you know , just as important as your @@UNKNOWN@@ , and it 's not more just for @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But also , for example . Who did that ?
How do you look at the field ?
Imagine you 're @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They get the ball .
They 're looking for a free .
Suddenly a lot of a sudden , you know , at the top of the top , and you 'll show you that the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They do n't think about it , but the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ the same thing .
They go into position .
Another thing for me .
It turns out , but you 'll meet .
The ball is completely control .
You do n't know where he goes .
But on the top of the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the point is , and he can respond .
He can start the ball , go down , @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The amount of @@UNKNOWN@@ , and the @@UNKNOWN@@ are at every time , and from any perspective .
This is going to make a new sound for the game .
People are going to get into mass , because they want to experience this experience .
@@UNKNOWN@@ want to be in the field .
You want to be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ is part of it , because it 's not worth not doing it .
But my question for you is : Are we happy to use them to use it ?
Would we just use bread for bread and games , normal conversation ?
I believe that we can use more for more .
I think we can use the @@UNKNOWN@@ to use the empathy in the people that we 're trying to show us how it is , in someone else else .
We know what this technology is worth worth .
They spend a lot of men in @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Which is a technology in Uganda or Russia , who 's going to see what the world wants to live under the conditions ?
What is this technology of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ or @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , who want to generation a generation of children , to think about all of all the science and science and not about @@UNKNOWN@@ and the @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
Ladies and gentlemen , the @@UNKNOWN@@ reality will come .
The questions that we ask is to make the decisions that we meet , the challenges that we face , are like , right in our hand .
Thank you .
I 'm recently after 23 years after the service of the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The most of these 23 years ago when I was at the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the County County , which is also the Golden @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The bridge is a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is the world for its beautiful view of San Francisco , the Pacific Ocean , and its own architecture is known .
Unfortunately , she 's also a cup of suicide , because they heard the world in most of the world .
The king @@UNKNOWN@@ became built .
Adam @@UNKNOWN@@ , the engineer engineer , who can say , " The bridge is @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
@@UNKNOWN@@ on the bridge , it 's not either either . "
But it 's more than 1,000 people from this bridge in death .
Some of them believe that one of the two between the two @@UNKNOWN@@ into a different dimension -- the bridge was so @@UNKNOWN@@ -- that you 're through the case of all of all of us , and it 's
I 'm going to tell you what 's going to happen when the bridge as a tool for suicide .
In the @@UNKNOWN@@ of bone bone , some of the organs organs organs .
Most of them die .
Those who are not going to die , usually usually in the water and water .
I do n't think that those who are the kind of @@UNKNOWN@@ in terms of view , what is a death death .
This is the wire .
Now , from the area to move the two and a half inches of the bridge in the bridge of the bridge .
Here 's most people before they take life .
In my experience , I can tell you that one person who has already been on the wire , and that in their own hour , it 's very hard to get back .
I 've taken this photograph last year than this young woman with a woman and talking about her life .
I 'm very happy to tell you that we 've been successful at the day they were on the other side of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
When I started working on the bridge , there was no training training .
You 've got his way through the whole phone .
It was n't just a @@UNKNOWN@@ for potential @@UNKNOWN@@ , but also for the police .
We 've got a long way behind us .
Today , doctors and doctors have the new doctor .
This is Jim @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And I met the last year in 2011 .
And I said , and when I came up , I looked at the way he started with a president of the bridge bridge bridge .
Jim was just 45 years old , and I was from New Zealand .
After talking about an hour talking to him , he asked us if we know the story of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We remember the ancient philosopher : @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ them on the Earth , with a box , and she said , " No never ever done it . "
And one day , as the curiosity , he opened up the box .
@@UNKNOWN@@ came out of suffering , suffering and all sorts of things that are talking about the humanity .
The only thing in the box was the hope .
And I said , " What happens when you open the box and no hope of it ? "
He was on a moment , sat down on the right .
This nice robot young man from New Zealand was just alive .
I 've talked about this night with @@UNKNOWN@@ parents , and I believe when I was talking to them , I did n't hear a lot of good , because the next day I called the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the family
@@UNKNOWN@@ parents had asked him .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ of a @@UNKNOWN@@ works on a lot of people .
I 'm going to show you the question : What would you do when a family , a friend or a woman person would be ?
What would you say ?
Would you know what you should say ?
In my experience , I 'm not just talking about it , but to listen .
@@UNKNOWN@@ to understand .
Do n't do it , you do n't do it , or you do n't tell the other person , you know how they feel , because you do n't know .
By just just here , you may be the point that the person needed it .
If you think someone someone is @@UNKNOWN@@ , you 're not afraid to this person .
For example , this question : " How people have a similar way to think about their lives , have you thought that thought ? "
The person wants to do it , but it makes your life and makes the point of it .
Some of them signs that you should pay attention : @@UNKNOWN@@ , the belief that the things can be bad and never better .
I made this talk a few days ago , and I 've got an email from a woman that I want to read you .
She had her son on the 19th century , January of this year , and she wrote me back to this email -- a few days before , and with their @@UNKNOWN@@ and their @@UNKNOWN@@ , I read it .
" Hi Kevin , probably you 're at the TED conference .
That must be a great experience .
I think I should go on this weekend on the bridge .
I wanted to give you a couple lines .
I hope you 'll have a lot of people with your message , and that go home and talk with their friends about it , and they also talk with their friends and so forth .
I still have a lot of @@UNKNOWN@@ , but still more moments when I 'm aware that Mike does n't go back home .
Mike is from @@UNKNOWN@@ to San Francisco , and after the 19th century , on his father to play the game of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
He 's never there .
I 've called the police in @@UNKNOWN@@ and call him the night as a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
On the next morning , two women came up to me , and they told me that the car car was down on the bridge .
A one saw how he looked at the day before @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ from the bridge .
I thank you so much for you to be able to be able to be able to be able to be @@UNKNOWN@@ , which may be too weak .
Who did n't have bad bad without that he had a mental disease ?
It should n't be just to keep your own life .
I pray for you and fight the fight .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ bridge , should be a transition across our beautiful Bay , and not a restaurant .
And fortunately , this week , @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
I ca n't imagine how much courage it took it to go to the bridge , and the way to go to the son of her son , and that does n't need to feel the courage .
I 'd like to give you a man who hope for me and hope .
And 11 11 years ago , I came to a message about one of the most powerful people in the region .
I went up with my @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I saw this young man , Kevin @@UNKNOWN@@ , as he looked at the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
For the next year , I heard about Kevin , how he talked about his depression and his @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And I decided to take it out of the day of doing it again , and over again , the @@UNKNOWN@@ and his life has another chance .
So as Kevin @@UNKNOWN@@ , I @@UNKNOWN@@ him .
" This is a new beginning , a new life . "
But I asked him , " What do you have to get back to the @@UNKNOWN@@ and the hope and a life ? "
And you know what he told me ?
He said , " You 've heard me .
You 've been talking about me , and you 've just heard listening . "
And after that event , I got a letter from my mother and I 'd like to put it here and I 'd like to read you .
" Oh , Mr. Mr. @@UNKNOWN@@ , nothing can be done by 11 11 , @@UNKNOWN@@ , but you 're one of the reasons why Kevin @@UNKNOWN@@ out of us .
I believe it was Kevin to help .
He was going to have a psychological disease that he was going to have the @@UNKNOWN@@ medicine .
And I 've been brought up with six months ago , completely @@UNKNOWN@@ about any @@UNKNOWN@@ , but thank you very much .
And it 's fine , he says .
We thank God for you .
@@UNKNOWN@@ in your hand , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
And at the end , she said , " @@UNKNOWN@@ when I was the hospital from San Francisco at the night , you were a patient .
Boy , I had to just put it up here . "
Today , Kevin has been a father father and a @@UNKNOWN@@ member of society .
He 's talking about the course of these days , and his depression in the hope that his story is different .
@@UNKNOWN@@ is not just in a job .
In the personal environment .
My grandfather took through life .
Now , indeed , when she had his own pain , it took me to have the possibility of ever ever known .
That 's suicide .
Most of the people or the people who think about suicide , never never thought about another person .
They just want their own pain .
That 's what happens in a three way : @@UNKNOWN@@ , drugs or alcohol , or death .
In my career , I 've been used to hundreds of my phone , and I was at hundreds of times of mental diseases and killed around the bridge .
At the rate of which I 've been involved in this , I 've only lost two people , but these are two .
One of them was 35 .
The other one was a man who I talked about about an hour .
And he did three times my hand .
The last thing he looked at me and said , " Kevin , I 'm sorry , but I have to go . "
And he broke .
I want to tell you that most of the people who we 're going to touch with the bridge is not to kill .
And also , most of the people who have come across , and they 've been able to talk about it , or those two percent of these people have told them that they were in the moment that they
I 'm going to tell people that the bridge is not only @@UNKNOWN@@ and San Francisco , but they connect people together .
The connection , or the bridge that we do is something that every single one of us would be .
@@UNKNOWN@@ is @@UNKNOWN@@ .
There are help . There 's hope .
Thank you very much .
The world makes you something that you 're not , but deep in your own , you know what you are , and the question you do in your heart , " How are you going to get ? "
I 'm maybe something special , but I 'm not alone , and not alone .
When I was a model model , it was such as the dream that I 've been going to have since my childhood .
My @@UNKNOWN@@ self - led to my inner truth , my inner self .
The reasons for me -- that 's coming back later , but I looked at this image , and then I felt like , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , that 's it ! You did it , you 've got . You
But last year , I realized that I was only at the beginning .
We 're all going to be in @@UNKNOWN@@ , from our families , from our religion , from our society , from the time we live in our own , even from our own bodies .
Some people have the courage to get rid of the limits that their skin , or the people of their own people .
These people are always a threat to the status status , which is what is like .
In my case , during the last few years ago , some of my neighbors , some of my friends , even my wife did n't know about my story .
When I was five years old , I 've got home home in the audience , and this shirt shirt on my head .
My mother asked me , " Why do you always take this shirt shirt on your head ? "
I said , " Mom , that 's my hair . I 'm a girl . "
I knew my own identity .
It 's less than the fact that it has been @@UNKNOWN@@ , but today we know that it 's complex , complex and complex .
Because of my success , I never had the courage to tell my story , because I did n't think it was wrong with me , but because of the way that the world that we do n't want to
Every day I 'm so grateful , because I 'm a woman .
I have a mother , a father and a family , which me , as I am .
A lot of them are not so lucky .
In Asia , there is a old tradition , the gender as a conversation .
There 's a consequence of compassion .
There 's a gods -- a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
When I was eight years old , I was at a @@UNKNOWN@@ on the @@UNKNOWN@@ to the party .
I stood up on the stage , and I knew it was this beautiful woman , right in front of me , and at that moment I knew this kind of woman I wanted to be .
When I was 15 years old , I was still known as a boy , I met a woman called @@UNKNOWN@@ .
She was @@UNKNOWN@@ for @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
At that night she asked me , " Why do n't you do it ? "
That moment changed my life .
Suddenly I found myself in the world of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Not a lot of people were in the first job , in @@UNKNOWN@@ for @@UNKNOWN@@ women , but I 'm doing it .
In the age of 15 and 17 years ago , I went to the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and in the course of the course , in the front of a @@UNKNOWN@@ , or sometimes it was the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and
I was also the @@UNKNOWN@@ of strangers , especially in New York in the United States .
But most importantly , I was some of my best friends in this community .
In the year , I called my mother from San Francisco , and I told me that my @@UNKNOWN@@ for a green @@UNKNOWN@@ was that I could go to the United States .
I told him .
I said , " Mom , I have fun .
I 'm here with friends , I love to travel and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Two weeks later , she started again , and she said , " Did you know what you 're going to do with you in the United States and your name ? "
I did n't have to hear anything .
My mother told me that I should use my name with two " E . "
She also told me when I met with 19 years ago .
It 's interesting to go into the most urban areas of some of the most effective , the most effective and @@UNKNOWN@@ surgery .
At the time , it was going to be able to do it in the United States , to do it , before you have to name his name and his gender .
In 2001 , I moved to San Francisco , and I do n't know when I 'm going to be @@UNKNOWN@@ with the name of @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That was an extraordinary moment .
For some people , this @@UNKNOWN@@ is a license to drive , or for a @@UNKNOWN@@ of alcohol , but for me , I was going to keep my @@UNKNOWN@@ and dignity .
I believed that my dream would be able to go to New York , and model .
A lot of them are not so lucky .
I think there 's a woman called @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's from New York , a young woman , the leader of her truth , but @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ her life .
For most of my background , the reality we live in .
Our @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ is so much like the general population .
Every year on 20 , we keep a global @@UNKNOWN@@ for the @@UNKNOWN@@ day .
I 'm here on this stage , because there 's a long story of people who have @@UNKNOWN@@ and against corruption .
These are @@UNKNOWN@@ Johnson and Sylvia @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Today , in that moment , my mind is my real @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I could n't mean no longer for me .
I want to make my best to help others , to protect their truth without shame and fear .
I 'm going to take a little bit about this day that day , it 's not going to have to be more , it 's going to be something that is going on 20 .
My @@UNKNOWN@@ truth would allow me to accept , as I am .
Can you do that ?
Thank you very much .
I 'd like to tell you what to say , especially to parents , but in the other sense of friends , with families , and all of those who have children or people who have trouble with the gender
Sure . @@UNKNOWN@@ : I 'm lucky .
And sometimes it does n't sometimes sometimes , so it 's just so that the gender identity is in the essence of it , is it ?
We 're going to talk to the birth of the gender of gender , and I 'm trying to talk a conversation about this , that the gender gender is not @@UNKNOWN@@ , and you want to give people to
The @@UNKNOWN@@ movement is still very beginning at the beginning of the beginning of @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
There 's still a lot to do .
It should be given .
It should be working for curiosity , for questions , and I hope you all of them are my emotional .
Thank you very much . That was beautiful . Thank you very much .
In a lot of societies societies and societies , fathers are known by their fathers , I 'm a single family , who has heard their daughter , and I 'm proud of that .
Before it was my daughter , but now I 'm my dad .
Very expensive and gentlemen , if we look at the story of humanity , the history of women is a story of corruption , inequality , violence and violence .
It 's not going to be welcome , not from her father and her mother .
The neighborhood comes from the mother to mother mother , and nobody @@UNKNOWN@@ the father .
A mother feel very uncomfortable when she gets a girl .
If she 's the first girl to the world , the first daughter , she 's sad .
If she 's the second daughter of the world , she 's shocked , and she 's an extraordinary one of the son of the birth of the third daughter , she makes sure you feel like a chimpanzee .
Not only the mother suffering , but also the daughter , the @@UNKNOWN@@ daughter , which is older than that , as she gets older .
With five , in a age when she was going to go to school , they go home , when their brothers brothers in school .
By the age of 12 years , they somehow have a good life .
You can have fun .
She can play with her friends on the street , and she can go out like a city .
But as a teenager , with 13 years old , you do n't have @@UNKNOWN@@ , and she does n't kill their @@UNKNOWN@@ from the house .
It 's in the four walls of their own @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's not a free person .
It 's going to be called the @@UNKNOWN@@ of her father , her brothers and her family , and when they call it the code , it will be killed .
Now , what 's interesting is that it 's called the code that 's not only the language of the girl , but also the life of the family family .
I know a family with seven brothers and a brother , and this one brother is in the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ to make a living for his seven and his parents , because he thinks , it 's @@UNKNOWN@@ , when
So the brother , the family of joy joy in his life and the happiness of his sisters on the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
There 's another thing that the social societies , and that 's @@UNKNOWN@@ .
A good girl has very quiet , very @@UNKNOWN@@ and very @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That 's the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The good girl has to be very quiet .
She should be very @@UNKNOWN@@ , and she should make the decisions of her father and her mother , and the decisions of the older people are going to be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Otherwise , she gets more than @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And what happens at the end ?
In the words of a poet , she gets married and @@UNKNOWN@@ , and then six - of - old daughters and daughters to get into the world .
And this cycle cycle always continue .
Very , ladies and gentlemen , these @@UNKNOWN@@ of millions of women could be changed when we think differently , when women and men are different than men and women in @@UNKNOWN@@ societies and societies in the developing world have
My brothers and sisters , when @@UNKNOWN@@ was born , when I first time -- and please , I think you may be honest , I did n't call a @@UNKNOWN@@ -- when I first met her in the eyes
For long before she was born , I thought about her name , and she was fascinated by the @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ from Afghanistan .
Her name was @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ and I name my daughter .
Some days after birth birth , after the birth of my daughter , my father came back -- and this was a slow accident -- he came back to me , and I had a @@UNKNOWN@@ with a family of
And when I looked at this -- all of them were men -- I took my pencil , and I put a line from my name and wrote " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
When she was older , with four and a half years ago , I took them in my school .
Now , why do I want to say that one girl in a school would be taken ?
Yeah , I have to mention it .
This may be known as early in Canada , in the United States and many other countries , but in poor countries , in @@UNKNOWN@@ societies , in societies , it 's a great event for the life of a
I 'm going to go to school with their identity and their name .
I 'm going to go to school that they 're in the world of their dreams and their dreams , where they 're going to find their talent for their future life .
I have five brothers and not one of them to go to school . It 's going to be @@UNKNOWN@@ , but two weeks ago , when I form the form of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I 'm going to
And the reason for me , I never never seen the name of my sisters on a document .
What my dad did n't give my sisters to my own sister , and I could n't give my own brothers , and I had to change my mind .
I 've always got the intelligence and the @@UNKNOWN@@ of my daughter .
I 've got them to sit at me when my friends came back .
I was @@UNKNOWN@@ them with me .
And all of these good values I tried to do in their personality .
And that was n't just for them , not just for @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I 've got these good values in my school , both with students and students .
I 've been education for education .
I brought my girl in my company , which I 've been taught with my lesson at @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I took my students with the lesson of what we call @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
My brothers and sisters , we 've been asked for more rights for women and we fight about more , more and more space for women in society .
But we 're just a new phenomenon .
A lot of human rights rights and human rights rights women rights .
It 's called @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This is the full - of - the - income innovation of women in all political , economic and social activities .
@@UNKNOWN@@ were lost .
And she was paid to school school .
Women were forced to break me , and they were @@UNKNOWN@@ from the markets .
The musicians were going to be silence , girls and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
A lot of death , but just a few people talked about things and it 's very @@UNKNOWN@@ , for their own rights , when you 're surrounded by these people who are @@UNKNOWN@@ and kill .
It 's really the @@UNKNOWN@@ thing .
In the age of 10 years , @@UNKNOWN@@ and she was on her right to education .
She wrote a newspaper for a blog blog she worked out for the New York Times , and she was talking to each other .
And her voice was the voice voice .
They spread like a " @@UNKNOWN@@ " in the world .
And that was the reason why the Taliban were not going to stop their campaign at the end of the last year .
It was the day of the last year for my family and me .
The world became a big black hole .
While my daughter between life and death @@UNKNOWN@@ , I told my wife in the ear , " Am I 'm talking about what my daughter and your daughter is going ? "
And she immediately said , " Please do n't give you .
You 're the right thing .
You have your life on the game , for the truth , for the peace , and for education , and your daughter was inspired by you , and you follow .
They 're both on the right way , and God will protect them . "
These few words were very much for me and I asked this question again .
While I was in the hospital , and the pain of pain was very strong , because she had @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I looked like a little dark on the face of my wife .
But my daughter never never .
She always said to me , " My @@UNKNOWN@@ smile is okay , and my favorite face in the face .
It 's going to be fine . Please do n't worry . "
She was a @@UNKNOWN@@ for us , and we gave us .
My brothers and sisters , we learned from their resilience in the most difficult times , and I 'm happy to share with you .
She thinks when my homework are completely completely .
She @@UNKNOWN@@ with her brothers , which I 'm very happy .
People ask me , which is so important to me as a leader , which is so @@UNKNOWN@@ , and so @@UNKNOWN@@ , so @@UNKNOWN@@ and so @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And I do n't tell you what I did .
I did n't do what I did .
I do n't have its wings @@UNKNOWN@@ . That 's all .
Thank you very much .
So 18 years ago , I started in the brain surgery , because it 's been a passion for me .
I 'm actually @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Anyway , after a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ with a stigma .
Am I 'm not smart or not ?
And if I ca n't get it again ?
@@UNKNOWN@@ to my surgery , I needed to use how much of everyone from over a dozen of these kinds of times I have to make a day , and I did n't just have anything that I had less
Some times it was just a few times .
But I love , and I did experiments , and so I decided to do this experiment , to try to find @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , because there 's actually no @@UNKNOWN@@ , the detail of it .
I tried to make different @@UNKNOWN@@ , and it took me out of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , like the invisible changes of my @@UNKNOWN@@ , my sense to me , my thinking , my behavior is different .
It was a very unusual case , a few months ago , and I was actually @@UNKNOWN@@ and chemicals , a typical species of a man in the early ' 90s , and I could n't think about how much
I was pretty extremely .
But I realized that I did n't try to be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I tried to make a little bit , and @@UNKNOWN@@ , the problem with me , and it just did n't come out .
But I believe that I have to come up with this experience a better understanding of men and I have to go back , and I 've got a lot better with men .
I wanted to do one of the @@UNKNOWN@@ of these things , and so forth , after my disease and surgery , I wanted to love my intelligence , my creative thinking , my @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And I think in some of these images , and that 's what I 'm going to think about the question -- how do I come up with these mental images that I 'm like to create a kind of
That way is not thinking .
@@UNKNOWN@@ like @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They thought , images and ideas were actually the same thing .
Today , this is a lot of a lot of @@UNKNOWN@@ and how our head is really going to be @@UNKNOWN@@ , but for me , it 's very simple : @@UNKNOWN@@ images , most of us , are really
So , after a few years , I 've got finally finally , and now I see a lot of great , very dramatic mental images with high levels and the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Now I 'm working on this way that I 'm going to see these invisible images from my head faster than my computer .
Imagine that if you could be a leader , it could be able to help with the imagination of the world .
Or a designer could make his music from his head .
This is incredible opportunities , how creative people can start at the speed of light .
I want to show you why I think we 're close to here . Here 's two weeks ago experiments of two of the groups groups in neuroscience .
Both of them were using technology technology , the MRI system -- to see the brain in the brain , and here you see a brain system of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and his colleagues at Harvard .
The left left shows the brain of a person who looks at a picture .
The middle - @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ a @@UNKNOWN@@ of the same person , just to imagine the image .
And the right @@UNKNOWN@@ came through the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the middle of the left south , and it says that the difference is almost zero .
That has been a lot of different people , with many different images , always with a similar result .
There 's so good like no difference between the actual visual image of the image and the @@UNKNOWN@@ -- the same image .
So let me show you a next experiment , which is from Jack @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ at the lab .
In this experiment , there were hundreds of thousands of hours of YouTube on YouTube videos during the brain of their brains , and it was created a set of data that created the reactions of the people on the
Then there 's been a new film , with new images , new people , new animals , a new @@UNKNOWN@@ and a new @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The computer , just by using the @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ the new brain , and then what he thought was that the person actually saw it .
On the right side , you can look at the trial of the computer and on the left side of the clip .
There 's no language .
We 're so close .
We need to use the resolution .
And I do n't forget that if you see a picture , and when you imagine the same image , almost exactly the same brain ,
So here 's this with the highest resolution of the current health of today today , and the resolution has really been used in the last year .
The next thing we need to do is that we need to measure the resolution of a little bit more likely to get rid of it .
How do we do that ?
There are many different ways of this approach .
A way of going to be able to fly the skull .
It 's nothing for me .
It 's going to be a lot of new @@UNKNOWN@@ , some of them from me , but at the moment of the latest results that we need to do is first , if we 're at the end of
@@UNKNOWN@@ experiences can be able to measure the amount of light , but it 's not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get
So I 'm going to call this one thing instead , instead of how we have a better grid .
We can make a lot more complicated structures with different different , a little bit like a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So why is this important ?
In the last few years , you were using the actual technology technology to make a huge amount of water , really , huge .
But most of the most recent decades in the detail we actually came through the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in radio radio radio @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So we should also use the magnetic structure , rather than a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , to the @@UNKNOWN@@ radio radio .
That 's how we can do with the combination of this magnetic pattern with the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of a much more information from a single scan .
In the way that we should be able to measure it , not only the river of blood blood , but also by the @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ , like already mentioned , and maybe even @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is
We 're going to be able to get our ideas directly on the digital media .
Can you imagine to speak language and directly with human thoughts ?
What would we be able to do ?
And how are we going to learn with the challenges of @@UNKNOWN@@ human minds ?
You think the Internet is big .
These are extremely big questions .
It could be @@UNKNOWN@@ as an instrument that we think and our @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And this instrument could be true for treatment of Alzheimer and diseases .
We have almost no other choice than that door open .
It 's hard to imagine that it 's going to be more than that .
We need to learn to get this step together .
Thank you .
I think we all of us .
Their @@UNKNOWN@@ can be someone who 's first to tell you that when you love them , or someone to tell you that you 're pregnant , or someone say , you have cancer , or one of the other
And after that @@UNKNOWN@@ , this is always hard , and even though you have a very different way to be able to have a secret , and we 're going to @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's scary , and we hate it . But it must be done .
Now , several years ago , I was working in @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ at the South Bronx , a @@UNKNOWN@@ in the city , and during my time , I was running through @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@
And depend on , like , " @@UNKNOWN@@ " My @@UNKNOWN@@ , and how little my hair were just because I 've been often asked the question , a lot of a little kid . "
And then the table at a table .
I @@UNKNOWN@@ my teeth a little bit harder in my life with a lot more @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The father broke his newspaper , and the mother looked at her kid a little bit .
But I did n't tell them .
So I told myself that I was going to say the next time .
I would do this hard deal .
So after a few weeks ago , again .
" Are you a boy or a girl ? "
I have my @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I even made a little clip from " The @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
So I 'm moving through a little bit , looking down and look at a @@UNKNOWN@@ girl in a pink @@UNKNOWN@@ , not a challenge , just a kid with a question : " You 're a boy or a
So I 'm moving through deep , @@UNKNOWN@@ me next to them , and I say , " Hey , I know it 's a little @@UNKNOWN@@ .
My hair are so short like a boy , and I 'm wearing @@UNKNOWN@@ , but I 'm a girl , and you know , you like , sometimes you like to see a pink @@UNKNOWN@@ and like you sometimes
So , I 'm more of the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
And this kid look at me in the eyes , without @@UNKNOWN@@ , and says , " My @@UNKNOWN@@ is @@UNKNOWN@@ with fish . "
Can I have a @@UNKNOWN@@ ? "
How about a @@UNKNOWN@@ ? "
That was the hard thing that I 've ever done .
And why ? Because the @@UNKNOWN@@ girl and I was honest .
As many of us , I had some secrets in my life , and it 's mostly that I 'm gay .
But you do n't look at people who have secrets with them .
You just know how it feels like a secret .
So my secret is not like you or not .
For example , I can give you a new reasons why my @@UNKNOWN@@ was more difficult than you , but actually , it 's not quite hard .
It 's hard .
Who says that it 's more difficult to tell someone that you just have to be @@UNKNOWN@@ , as someone said to you , is that you just put it down ?
Who says that his @@UNKNOWN@@ - @@UNKNOWN@@ story is harder than when you tell your @@UNKNOWN@@ child that you will be going to break up ?
There 's no harder , there 's only hard .
We need to stop doing our own problems with other people that we 're trying to do with our @@UNKNOWN@@ or worse .
At a certain point in our lives , we all have our secrets and we like to say , or at least more security than what happens when we put it .
But I 'm here to tell you that it 's independent , which is your secret , you do n't have to deal with it .
I was wearing a @@UNKNOWN@@ , a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I was n't going to leave the question , which was ready to go with every woman who went to the University .
I was afraid of fear that was @@UNKNOWN@@ in the corner , with my dark secret and @@UNKNOWN@@ my fear , and a muscle muscle is the @@UNKNOWN@@ thing I had ever done .
My family , my friends , completely @@UNKNOWN@@ -- I had my entire life to try to try to do these people , and I asked the world to make the head .
I @@UNKNOWN@@ the pages of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , which we all were so long after that , but if you 're not going to throw them down , you will kill them .
One of my @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ was in my daughter .
And after a little @@UNKNOWN@@ , called a woman , " I love @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
And it started to fight the battle .
" @@UNKNOWN@@ , were you ever in the @@UNKNOWN@@ ? "
" Well , we actually have friends friends in San Francisco . "
" We 've never been there , but we heard that it 's @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
" @@UNKNOWN@@ , do you know my @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
He 's really good and he never heard a friend . "
" @@UNKNOWN@@ , which shows you most people ?
Our @@UNKNOWN@@ ? Our favorite .
And you know who we love ? Jack .
Jack is our favorite . "
And then a woman , very , very hard to help me support their support , and to know what it was on my side , @@UNKNOWN@@ it , and eventually it came out of her . "
I could go back to my friend and my @@UNKNOWN@@ table , and I 've been thinking about their response , their @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and their @@UNKNOWN@@ to overcome the edges of political policies that I had done , or
Sure , it would be easier to do with their fingers on their @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's a lot harder to get there , where they 're right now , and the fact that they have tried to do it .
And what can you do with someone else , except it ?
If you start to someone to be honest , you have to be willing to get back .
@@UNKNOWN@@ conversations are still not my own .
Ask questions that I 've ever done .
But I 'm going to get better , and I 'm like , " I like , " I like to call the three @@UNKNOWN@@ -- girls .
Look at these @@UNKNOWN@@ objects , but with the knowledge that it 's always difficult to be secret .
Number one : Be real .
Take the @@UNKNOWN@@ . Be yourself .
The kid in the @@UNKNOWN@@ had no @@UNKNOWN@@ , but I was @@UNKNOWN@@ .
If you want someone to be honest , you have to know that you 're suffering .
Number two : Be honest . Tell it . Just do it .
If you know you 're gay , you just say it .
If you look at your parents , you might be more likely to be able to hope that hope .
Do n't give you a little hope .
They talk about your own truth .
Sorry .
And on this way , some people might be hurt , sorry , sorry , which is what you 've done , but you do n't even ever for what you are .
And yes , some of you may be frustrated , but that 's not the problem , not your own .
These are their expectations of who you are not .
That 's not their story .
The only story that matters is that you want to write .
So if you look at the next time of your secret , and you feel the @@UNKNOWN@@ , you know that we all know what it is .
They feel very much , but they 're not .
We know that it 's hard , but you have to open up , but no matter what your secret is , I 'm going to show you that there are lots of other people who have their secrets with
intelligence -- what 's that ?
If we look at how intelligence intelligence , it was the famous quote of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , " The question , whether it 's a machine , you can think about something like the question , if you have a
When @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ wrote this , he wanted to get the early @@UNKNOWN@@ of the computer scientist , like , for example .
But if we think about looking back and thinking about what we 've done today , what we 're going to do is that we 've been able to build the machines , machines machines , and we want to
So I started a few years ago , trying to understand the fundamental structure of intelligence intelligence .
Let 's take a step back .
And start with a thought .
Imagine if we did n't know that all of biology , biology , intelligence or intelligence , but fantastic telescopes , we can look at the Earth , and we have a very long life , so we can see
We see a very strange effect .
Because that the Earth is over hundreds of thousands of thousands of asteroids that 's going to get up to a point , and that the point that it was about , in the year 2000 , @@UNKNOWN@@ , the
When we do n't understand the actual reason that we 're going to save ourselves .
We 're trying to avoid an impact .
But if you 'd be an idea if all of you do n't know that the idea of intelligence intelligence , you would be forced to make a physical theory , why you have to see the surface of the
I argue that the same question is , how the question of nature is nature .
That 's why I 've been looking at the trial that I started a few years ago , a lot of different issues , from different scientific areas that I think , all of a single thing , intelligence intelligence
So with the whole knowledge of all of these different areas , I asked myself a few years ago , whether there 's a intelligence intelligence theory that we can do all of these @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
Is there a single equation of intelligence ?
And the answer , I think , yes . "
What you see here is a statement of what that intelligence is a force , which is so that the future will be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It seems so that the future future @@UNKNOWN@@ is going to be able to do it , or even more options , with a strength , with the diversity of diversity for the world for a long - term future
In a short term , intelligence does n't like it in a case .
intelligence is trying to think of the future future , and more opportunities to open open .
Now , with this equation equation , of course , what can we do with that ?
What can they do ?
Is it human intelligence ?
Are they artificial artificial intelligence ?
Now , I 'm going to show you a video that I believe , some of these amazing applications of this equation .
But what 's if that @@UNKNOWN@@ connection between between intelligence and intelligence on a dark context ?
What if people do n't just be able to increase in the production of neurons , but they 're actually directly directly ?
In order to figure out what we 've got a engine , [ a part of a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , " which is going to increase the production of parts of any system in the system that
@@UNKNOWN@@ , a lot of @@UNKNOWN@@ , games have been played , and even at the same time , without any @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Here 's some examples of @@UNKNOWN@@ in action .
As a human @@UNKNOWN@@ , without @@UNKNOWN@@ , we see here , @@UNKNOWN@@ them like a @@UNKNOWN@@ on a car .
This behavior is remarkable because we 've never got a goal .
She just did n't choose to choose the sign .
This ability to balance , it 's going to be able to do with medical engineering and engineering tools .
So , like some of the objects in their environment as tools , they 're able to be able to create in our spaces spaces , we see here , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , has made their own , a large
This ability to be able to find out of @@UNKNOWN@@ and agriculture .
Also , just like some of them , they 're working together with both at the same end of the two end of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , to get food food , and we see here that it 's how to
These @@UNKNOWN@@ have interesting effects for @@UNKNOWN@@ and lots of other areas .
@@UNKNOWN@@ can be based on a variety of areas .
Here we see it a successful game game game itself , which makes their potential to play .
So here 's what we see here , how they create new connections in social networks , where friends are always touch with touch , and they 'll get the network together .
It 's the same ability to use it with medical medical energy , energy and intelligence .
So here 's what we 're looking at , which is a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is successful successful , and it 's going to be able to spread their entire global across the Pacific in the Pacific .
For the same reason , it 's @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ on problems in @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
At the end , we 're going to see , like @@UNKNOWN@@ , " It 's going to buy a lot of expensive , expensive @@UNKNOWN@@ of a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and it 's going to produce the @@UNKNOWN@@
And this ability to be able to use this application of @@UNKNOWN@@ and insurance .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ : We 've just seen that a series of clearly human - intelligent behavior , as the @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ and social cooperation , all of a single equation , which makes a system to
This leads to a deep irony .
If we go back to the beginning of the word of the machine , " the game " @@UNKNOWN@@ , " and then there was always the idea that if we were using artificial intelligence , it would be a
The machines would respond against us .
One important thing about this work is that we may have been known for decades before the scientific @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ are not going to be smart , and then @@UNKNOWN@@ , and try to make the world .
Another important thing is the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I 'm going to ask you , how do you have the ability to choose goals , from that basic ?
So , to know , Richard Feynman , famous physicists , who wrote that when the human civilization , it was just going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
My equivalent of this statement , a little bit to leave to the artificial artificial intelligence , or to help people to love intelligence , is that this is intelligence .
Thank you very much .
We 're looking at a historical point point between the connection to the stars and the loss of our @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In the last year , our understanding of the world in the universe grew up .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ of NASA took thousands of other planets in other @@UNKNOWN@@ . The Earth is only one of the planet in our galaxy .
Now , this is a rocket paradigm . It 's like the light of stars through @@UNKNOWN@@ planets , and it 's going to be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The media data shows us the size of planets and their distance to their @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So we can figure out whether these planets are small and @@UNKNOWN@@ , like the planet planet in our solar system , and also , how much light they get from their sun .
And again , this gives us some of the evidence that these discovered were planets , or not .
But as we discovered this amount of technology , we can be able to see worlds worlds that our own planet planet can be under the load of humanity .
@@UNKNOWN@@ was the last year last year .
Now , hundreds of old ice and ice @@UNKNOWN@@ in the decades of decades .
These global change in our environment that we have started to move more of our control .
But I 'm not @@UNKNOWN@@ . I 'm @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I study the @@UNKNOWN@@ on the @@UNKNOWN@@ of planets , in the hope , in the universe in places that we can find new life .
You might say I 'm looking for space space .
When I think of the life of life in the universe , I can tell you the more you look for planets like the Earth , the more you think about their own .
Every of these new worlds allow us to make a comparison between the new and planets that we know at the best .
Let 's think about our neighbors , Mars .
The Mars is small and @@UNKNOWN@@ , and it 's a little bit away from the Sun , but @@UNKNOWN@@ as a @@UNKNOWN@@ , when he discovered in a library .
The Mars could actually be @@UNKNOWN@@ . That 's one of the reasons why we study it so much .
We have our @@UNKNOWN@@ , like " @@UNKNOWN@@ " , look at the surface of the beginning to the beginning of life .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , like the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ mission , @@UNKNOWN@@ samples from the atmosphere , so we can understand how the Mars @@UNKNOWN@@ Mars .
Now , private companies do n't want to protect them in the space room , but also the @@UNKNOWN@@ opportunity to live on Mars .
But even if these images of the surface of Mars , we do n't think about our @@UNKNOWN@@ in our home space -- places that we 're going to do with big discoveries and new borders -- that 's Mars
Think about how much our own country are @@UNKNOWN@@ , places that compared to Mars , and alive .
Again , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ places in the Earth is the air , full of oxygen , the ocean , the ocean that we 're going to produce thousands of miles .
I 'm afraid that the @@UNKNOWN@@ across the other planets of the other planets of a planet , there is a long , dark shadow , some people believe that the Mars is going to save us , if we
So I 'm looking for other planets on the planet , but I 'm so powerful this idea .
There 's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars , but who says , Mars would be our plan , B like the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , who 's really going to go at the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Thank you .
But the study of new planets and the protection of the Earth is not a contradiction .
These are the truth of two sides of the same future : life to understand and to save the future .
@@UNKNOWN@@ with extreme @@UNKNOWN@@ on our planet .
They 're just closer to our home .
If we understand how we can see , @@UNKNOWN@@ places in the world , in places that we can move together , we can be able to be able to make both our own environment as well as they 're
And at the end of an idea , the @@UNKNOWN@@ - @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And the physicists looked at @@UNKNOWN@@ , and once , why do n't we have any signs of the world , but where our universe has been so old , and so many different species .
Where is this life life ?
One of the solution of the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ is that societies , the technologies are so far that they lives on other planets in terms of the world , as important as it is to be able to protect their
It 's @@UNKNOWN@@ to believe that the other other planets of the planet can save us from us to save ourselves , but the health of our planet and the study of other planets can create each other .
If we really think about the ability to think of the health of Mars for people to be able to do it , it should be quite possible that the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the Earth .
Thank you very much .
A few years ago , I broke my own house .
I was just at home , and it was about midnight , in the middle of the winter winter , I had my friend @@UNKNOWN@@ at the end of the city at the end of the city , and the
When I was on the front , and in my pockets , I realized that my key was missing .
I could see them through the window , they were there on the table where I left them .
I ran out of the house , and I kept all the other windows and windows that were @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And I started thinking about @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , I had my cell phone , but it was going to be a long , until a @@UNKNOWN@@ came , and it was cold .
I could n't work with my friend 's @@UNKNOWN@@ , because I was going to have a early flight to Europe , and I had to make my breath .
@@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ , I found a big rock , and then the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and put it into a piece of glass , and I put it across the hole , with
That would cost a lot of it , but probably not much more than a @@UNKNOWN@@ in the middle of the night , so I thought I was doing this kind of thing .
I 'm a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and I know a little bit about how the brain is stress .
It turns out what 's going to increase the heart rate , it 's wrong the @@UNKNOWN@@ and the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The next morning I had a little bit of sleep , and I was worried about the hole in the window , I had to think of my call and call the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and the @@UNKNOWN@@ meeting in Europe
It was just when I started on the @@UNKNOWN@@ on the switch , and I realized that my flag was missing .
So I @@UNKNOWN@@ in 40 minutes through the ice and ice back home , my @@UNKNOWN@@ and back back to the airport , so I 've been able to do that , but my place was taken , and I
I had a lot of time thinking about this eight hours without sleep .
And I wondered , if there are things that I can do , what I can do , which can prevent the bad bad things ?
Or at least , if something happens , the likelihood that it 's going to be a total disaster .
So I thought about it , but my thought was just a month later .
And I was at home with my colleagues ' 80s , the Nobel Prize , the Nobel Prize , and won the @@UNKNOWN@@ of my @@UNKNOWN@@ window , and I realized , and he told me , he wrote something
He had written by the psychologist of Robert @@UNKNOWN@@ , who wrote a few years ago , which were called the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
You all know what the @@UNKNOWN@@ is @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Every time there is a @@UNKNOWN@@ , a @@UNKNOWN@@ and trying to figure out what 's wrong , right ?
In @@UNKNOWN@@ , like Steve @@UNKNOWN@@ , looking at it , and figure out what you could go wrong and then try to figure out what you can do with this stuff , not to avoid the damage .
What I want to talk about today is a few things that we can do in a form of a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Some of them are obvious , others are not .
I start with the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Let me go home at a place for things that you do .
It sounds a sense , and it 's also , but it 's a lot of science that 's based on our memory memory .
A part of the brain , which is developed by tens of thousands of years , to be able to see where important things have been used -- where the good is where you can see fish , where the
This is the part of the brain that 's in @@UNKNOWN@@ in London .
It 's the part of the brain that 's going to be able to find their crazy .
And if you ask yourself , someone did this experiment , and the smell of the smell was @@UNKNOWN@@ , and they still had their @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They did n't use smell , but the @@UNKNOWN@@ , which has been developed in the brain to find things .
It 's really good for things that do n't move much , but not so good for things that are moving .
That 's why we 're driving , @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ it in a house for your key -- a door to the door , maybe a beautiful photograph .
For your @@UNKNOWN@@ , a certain thing .
For your @@UNKNOWN@@ , a certain table .
If you look at a certain place , and you 're going to keep your things going to be when you 're looking for them .
What about travel ?
So let me give you a @@UNKNOWN@@ of your @@UNKNOWN@@ , your driver , your @@UNKNOWN@@ , your @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ it , so it 's in the cloud .
So you can get @@UNKNOWN@@ , when these things are lost , or you 're going to be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
These are pretty obvious things .
Do n't forget to stress the brain .
@@UNKNOWN@@ is @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And the part of the @@UNKNOWN@@ -- it 's to realize that you do n't have to stress in their best form , and it 's necessary to practice .
There 's probably not a situation situation when you 're connected to a medical decision .
At some point of all of us in the situation , we have to make a very important decision to have to know about our own medical health , or the one that person to help this .
So I want to talk about this .
I 'm going to talk about a very special @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But this is an example of personal health care , and even for decision - making , and social -- any kind of decision - making that can make sure of the @@UNKNOWN@@ of facts .
So let me go to the doctor , and says , " I 've got your results from the lab and your @@UNKNOWN@@ is something . "
Well , you all know that high levels of @@UNKNOWN@@ with the risk of mental disease is @@UNKNOWN@@ , heart disease , heart .
So you think , well , you 're not very good and her doctor says , " I 'd like to give you a little bit of your way to help you get your blood @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
You know , you know , you know , and you know that they 're going to @@UNKNOWN@@ the drug drugs in the world , you know , people even know what they take .
So you think , " Yeah ! Give me the @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
But at this point , you should ask you a question , to think of a statistics , you should ask you to talk about most of the doctors do n't want to talk about and talk about the more
Over the number of treatment of treatment .
What is that ?
It 's the number of people who have a drug or an operation or a brain that needs to be done by another person .
You think , what is this crazy thing ?
The number should be .
My doctor would n't worry if it could n't help .
But the medical practice does n't work .
And that 's not the doctor , when someone is , when scientists is .
We do n't have the rules of any damage .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , 90 percent of all drugs are only 30 percent 50 percent of the people .
What do you think that is the number of the treatment of the treatment of treatment for the most expensive ?
How many people have to take it before before a leader ?
300 .
This is a @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , independent @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I 've just asked the numbers .
300 people have to take the drug a year before a heart or a heart or a heart or the brain .
Now you may probably say , " Okay , a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Why not ? Give me the recipe . "
But here 's what you should ask for a different statistics and say , " Tell me about the side effects . "
For this particular drug , 20 percent of the patients are patients .
And here are bad things -- @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , pain - @@UNKNOWN@@ -- -- but now you think , " Five percent , maybe it does n't mean me , but I do n't need that means . "
But a moment .
Remember that you do n't realize .
Think about it , even if you can do that , you do n't have to be able to @@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ at the moment .
300 people take the tools . One person is helped , five percent of these 300 effects effects , which are 15 people .
It 's 15 times more likely to give you the way that it helps you .
I 'm not saying whether you 're going to take the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I 'm just saying you should talk about your doctor .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ requires it , it heard the principle of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They have the right to get this information to decide whether you want to take the risk in their own or not .
You may think I 've got this number as @@UNKNOWN@@ , but this is a typical number of treatment .
For most of the treatment of men , more than 50 percent , the treatment of cancer , which is the number of drugs .
Right , Chris surgery need to be more than a person .
And here 's the side effects of 50 percent of patients patients .
These are @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ .
If they 're one of the short 50 percent of them , they do n't think about it or two years .
So the idea of the computer @@UNKNOWN@@ is to think about the questions that you might ask to ask the conversation .
They do n't want to do it at the moment .
And you should also think about things like quality .
Because you often have a choice , you want to have a @@UNKNOWN@@ , life life , or a life life that could be very painful ?
It 's going to talk about it , and think about your family and friends with friends .
They may be in the moment of self - old , but at least , you 're going to think in this way .
In stress , our brain brain , and one of the things that 's going to happen is that every amount of functions .
There 's an evolutionary reason .
@@UNKNOWN@@ with a predator , you do n't need your @@UNKNOWN@@ , or your immune system , or your immune system , because if your body is oxygen , and you 're not going to slow down , you may
In fact , that 's one of the things that during the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , the way , thinking about how @@UNKNOWN@@ and his colleagues have shown .
So we have to train these kinds of situations in the future .
The most important thing to recognize is that we 're all at all .
We 're going to go down and fail .
It 's about @@UNKNOWN@@ what the mistake might be able to be able to use the damage to the damage , or the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the bad things of bad things .
To go back to the night night , when I came from my journey , I asked my @@UNKNOWN@@ , a @@UNKNOWN@@ on the door with @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ with a @@UNKNOWN@@ combination .
And I 've got to say , I 've always got a lot of @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I have a lot of email that I read .
I 'm not very @@UNKNOWN@@ , but I see an organization , and I 'm on the way .
Thank you very much .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
It means to play .
If you play a video game , and in the @@UNKNOWN@@ , you have to say , " @@UNKNOWN@@ you have to play .
Two " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
Four " @@UNKNOWN@@ , " @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This is my drawing of a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , which shows how many thousands of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , " you 've never got a complete silence .
That 's my personal definition of silence : a very dark sound .
I want to tell you something about the story of American American @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , and something to my background .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ came from the 18 century .
So you have about 200 years ago .
I was born deaf , and I taught taught that sound is not part of my life .
At the time I thought .
Today , I do n't know that this was n't true .
@@UNKNOWN@@ were a big part of my life , and I came into a sense .
When I was living in a world full of sound , and how live in a stranger country , the rules of rules , the rules , the same language , behavior , the same language , often , and
How can I hear sound ?
I watch human behavior and the response to sound sounds .
People are like my speakers , they sound sound .
I 'm learning and behavior behavior .
And at the same time , I learned that I read sound sounds , and I think how people respond to me .
So I learned how to say , " @@UNKNOWN@@ the door . "
" Do n't make a lot of sound when you get out of the chips . "
" @@UNKNOWN@@ not , and while you eat it , you do n't stop with the @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
All these things I call " sound @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
Maybe I think more about sound sounds like the average @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I 'm at sound @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I 'm always sitting in @@UNKNOWN@@ , nervous about what happens next .
So this drawing .
@@UNKNOWN@@ to decide .
@@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ .
You notice that the @@UNKNOWN@@ -- there are no notes between the lines .
Because the lines have sound sounds through the @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In the @@UNKNOWN@@ movement .
This is a sign for @@UNKNOWN@@ in @@UNKNOWN@@ .
A typical @@UNKNOWN@@ of five lines .
It does n't feel about it , with the thumb to @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In my drawings , I 'm at four lines lines .
In 2008 , I had the opportunity to go to Berlin , Germany , Germany , for a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Before I was working on the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In this summer , I went to see different York and ice , when I went from a place to the next , I realized that there were no art art .
At the time , the sound of the trend and I realized that there was no visual art .
So sound sounds in art art .
Is it going to move me from the art ?
I realized that this did n't have to be the case .
I knew sound .
I know it so good that I ca n't just get through my ears .
I could actually feel it , or something like , or even as an idea .
So I decided to give the property of sound and @@UNKNOWN@@ into my @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And I decided to explain what I 've been taught about sound , and it was too @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I started a new @@UNKNOWN@@ .
When I asked the @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ me and support that I got .
I realized , sound is like money , power -- social media .
In my mind , I always felt that the sound of your thing was , of @@UNKNOWN@@ people .
@@UNKNOWN@@ are so powerful that they 're going to make me up , and my work @@UNKNOWN@@ or @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I decided to be proud .
There 's a strong culture about the word language .
And just because I do n't have my voice voice , but it seems like that I had no voice .
So I have to work with people who are going to help me as a @@UNKNOWN@@ and become my voice .
So I 'm able to keep in this society today .
In school , working on the work , and I work with various @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Their voices will be voice to my voice and identity .
They help me .
Their voices have value and it .
By the way I 'm going to share their voice , I 'm going to create an extraordinary form of currency , so similar to a @@UNKNOWN@@ with very high levels .
If I do n't practice this practice , I 'm just able to get into something , and not a form of social media .
With sound as my new @@UNKNOWN@@ , I made the music of music .
I was surprised to see the @@UNKNOWN@@ between music and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
For example , it 's not going to be completely completely on paper , and I 'll be asked .
Same with the concept of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They 're both extremely @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ -- which means that little things changes the whole meaning of @@UNKNOWN@@ and sounds .
Here 's a piano metaphor , so they understand better how it works .
Imagine a piano .
@@UNKNOWN@@ becomes a lot of different @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
If you 're going to play a piece of a different signal -- like @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , your hands , etc . "
@@UNKNOWN@@ is a much more like a race -- all the 10 fingers have to be able to get the brain , to get a clear idea or a idea of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
If only one would change the voice , it would be a completely different meaning .
The same thing with the music , which is , sound and sound .
In @@UNKNOWN@@ , you can play through play with various different ideas .
So , the sign for @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That 's the sign of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I look at it .
I 'm doing it .
Oh ...
Oh .
What do you look at ?
@@UNKNOWN@@ .
Then I thought , " What if I @@UNKNOWN@@ through music music ? "
Would I create a sign , and it 's going to repeat again , it would be a kind of visual music .
For example , this sign for " day , " and the sun goes on .
That 's " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
If I do it again and slow , it looks like a piece of music .
@@UNKNOWN@@ ...
Same with the " night . "
" The night . "
This is @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That took me to think about three different ways of thinking , " last night , " night , " " night , " after all .
@@UNKNOWN@@ has the third more much more than the other two .
This is what it looks like time in @@UNKNOWN@@ , and how the rest of the body can fit into the body .
For example , @@UNKNOWN@@ is a hand , @@UNKNOWN@@ are two hands , @@UNKNOWN@@ in the next , and before the body .
The first example is a long time ago .
Then , " past , " and the last , my favorite , with a very popular and dramatic idea , " it was once . "
" @@UNKNOWN@@ " is a musical term with a specific @@UNKNOWN@@ of four inches per four .
I see the word " @@UNKNOWN@@ , " I think , " I automatically automatically . "
So , @@UNKNOWN@@ , right hand , @@UNKNOWN@@ , left hand .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ are over the head and the chest .
I 'm going to show you a show of " @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
Can you please please ?
All the hands up .
Now we 're going to do it with the head and the chest , like the @@UNKNOWN@@ , or the same time .
Yeah , exactly .
" @@UNKNOWN@@ love " in International @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
International @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , as you know , is a visual tool for communication and cultures in all the world .
The second thing I 'd like to show you -- I 'm going to do it again .
And now .
This is " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
Now the third -- again .
And again .
This is " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
Now all three .
" @@UNKNOWN@@ love , " @@UNKNOWN@@ " and " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
Good job , all of you .
Look at how much different signs are . You all look at your head head , and you have a lot different languages .
It 's amazing to see how alive and successful @@UNKNOWN@@ is just like the music .
But we live in a very @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ world .
Just because it does n't sound sound , it does n't have any social media .
We need to think about what social media and @@UNKNOWN@@ itself , its own shape of the developing world -- without sound .
This one might be able to create a more society society .
Perhaps the people have to understand that you do n't have to be deaf to have to be learning to learn that you have to hear music to learn music .
@@UNKNOWN@@ is so much richer than I wish you have the same experience .
I want to invite you to imagine your ears to open your eyes to open our culture and our visual language .
And you never know , maybe you can fall in it .
Thank you .
As a kid told me , my parents always said , " You can go down , as long as you 're @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
So freedom was connected .
But my imagination gave me a wonderful wonderful place where everything was possible .
So I grew up in one of the orange .
With the time I learned that adults do n't make a mess , and we 're very good at it , obviously .
@@UNKNOWN@@ : I 'm going to grow up and teach @@UNKNOWN@@ and innovation on the Hong Kong .
It does n't take long , until my students go on the beach , and I 'm going to go down at @@UNKNOWN@@ .
As a good citizens , we have no money -- and no , he does n't eat an alcohol , and if it does n't have it from me .
It 's sad , but today is more than 80 percent of the oceans .
That 's @@UNKNOWN@@ reality .
@@UNKNOWN@@ moved with big ships and large nets , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and she looked under the microscope , @@UNKNOWN@@ them , and they collect the data on cards .
But it takes very well , and it 's very expensive . It 's quite low , very high - @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But with my students at age between six and 15 , we could find a better way .
So we turned our little classrooms in a studio .
We built these little @@UNKNOWN@@ , with various @@UNKNOWN@@ , so small children can help .
And one thing I have to say , children with @@UNKNOWN@@ and great .
Not really .
So , back to the plastic .
We collect plastic and @@UNKNOWN@@ it in the same way in the ocean , which is very small because it 's going down .
And we 're working .
I 'm going to make the imagination of my students .
My job is to use the best idea of any of the @@UNKNOWN@@ idea , and that 's something that 's going to work .
So we came up with us that instead of instead of data instead of data .
So we create a picture of the robot with a robot -- robots love .
The next step we call @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We 're so fast enough to eat food in the @@UNKNOWN@@ when we 're working on it .
We built it in @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , a little bit of @@UNKNOWN@@ , which was slowly through the water , and through the plastic -- this is the image that we see in the robot .
So we see @@UNKNOWN@@ , the slow thing on the surface of the computer , the computer on the board , and this is the size of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , so that we get a @@UNKNOWN@@ , how much plastic
We 've created this invention to step and step online on a site for the @@UNKNOWN@@ called " @@UNKNOWN@@ , " which hope someone someone even even more .
The great thing about the project was that students had a local problem , and they tried to solve it .
But my students in Hong Kong is a @@UNKNOWN@@ of children .
They look at news , they 're on the Internet , and they 're looking at this image .
A kid , probably under 10 , which is a @@UNKNOWN@@ with @@UNKNOWN@@ hands on the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the largest @@UNKNOWN@@ in Bangladesh .
They were very shocked , because this is the water that they drink and in the water that water water in the fish -- that 's the place where they live .
You see that the water is brown , which is brown , which is the oil is brown , it 's all of it , and it 's just hard to see what 's in the water .
But there 's a relatively simple technology called @@UNKNOWN@@ , which you can see in the water .
So we built a small prototype of a @@UNKNOWN@@ that we can do different parts of the protein that can make different components , which can help create the content in the water .
So we @@UNKNOWN@@ this platform of prototype and sent him up to Bangladesh .
The great thing about this project was next to the @@UNKNOWN@@ of a local problem or the study of my students and their friends , to help others from others .
I was inspired by the second experiments , and I wanted to take a step forward -- and maybe even a more difficult problem , which I 'm at the heart .
I 'm half - the - year - old and half - year - old , and maybe you can remember the massive earthquake in Japan .
It was so clear that it was a series of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ -- they 're going to call the tsunami -- and the tsunami have a lot of cities across the East East Japan .
More than 14 people were dead .
And it was also the @@UNKNOWN@@ in @@UNKNOWN@@ , a @@UNKNOWN@@ on the water .
Today , I read it in terms that we had 300 million dollars from the @@UNKNOWN@@ directly in the Pacific .
Today , the whole Pacific @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ through @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Even from the West Bank , you can measure it all over .
On the map , it seems to be like most of the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the Japanese coast of California , and most of it looks out of it , it 's blue .
Well , it 's actually more complicated .
I 've been going every year since the accident , and I wanted to keep up with any other @@UNKNOWN@@ on the country , in the river -- and then we wanted to bring the children .
Of course , we did n't do it because it did n't follow their parents .
But we told each night , " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
It seems like they did n't have it seriously seriously , but they did it because they 're going to live the rest of their lives with the same thing .
So we did it with them all the data of the day , and our other approach , strategy , etc .
And we created a very popular , @@UNKNOWN@@ map of the region .
So , we built a @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and the real - time - scale thing , and the temperature of water , and @@UNKNOWN@@ water to @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So we could see that the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ from the @@UNKNOWN@@ into the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and in the ocean .
That was an estimate .
In this background , we created an expedition , the wars as close to the last two years ago .
We @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and a half miles away from the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and we brought up with help of the @@UNKNOWN@@ in the ocean , from the bottom of the sea , with one of us , and we developed
We made the samples in little @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ hundreds of different from buildings , and we built a map of the @@UNKNOWN@@ at the bottom of the sea , especially at @@UNKNOWN@@ , where fish fish , and I
You see a evolution -- from a local local and a global problem .
It was exciting to these different steps , but with very simple open - source technologies .
But at the same time , it became more powerful , because we just started starting to measure the damage .
We did n't start looking for these problems .
So I wonder , why do n't we just do it and try to find better ways to do all of these things .
The classroom started to small small for us , so we found a @@UNKNOWN@@ in Hong Kong , and we put it into a large - scale site site on social and environmental consequences .
It 's in the middle of Hong Kong , and I 'm a center for the work with wood , chemistry , chemistry , a little bit of biology and biology , which is basically able to build it together
A place where the adults and children can play together .
It 's a place where it 's going to be able to learn from adults , and where adults are going to be child .
@@UNKNOWN@@ !
We ask questions like : Is there a future of @@UNKNOWN@@ with energy energy ?
For example .
Or can we increase the mobility of the generation generation , by using the standard @@UNKNOWN@@ in cool , electrical devices ?
@@UNKNOWN@@ , oil and @@UNKNOWN@@ like @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , but the worst legacy is there , our children with lies .
We ca n't afford to afford more of the children of the physical reality , because we need their imagination to find solutions .
So , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ -- we need to create the new generation , the way to make the environment and the people make people , and actually actually make a difference .
Thank you .
Two @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , two radical @@UNKNOWN@@ .
One is from thousands of @@UNKNOWN@@ , the others from one single @@UNKNOWN@@ .
One is @@UNKNOWN@@ , the other organic .
One of the environment is going to create another other .
One of them is designed by nature , which is different .
He said , he looked at the @@UNKNOWN@@ in a @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is going to fight .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ was @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But things are not going to be done .
They grow .
In our tiny , of life , the cells that we 're wearing all the information that the function and control each other cell .
It also have consequences .
@@UNKNOWN@@ since the Industrial Revolution became the world of the design of the production of production and production .
@@UNKNOWN@@ have a world made by many parts of the world , and the idea of designers and architects , who were trained to meet their objects as a @@UNKNOWN@@ of DNA components with different functions .
But you can find out in nature .
For example , the human skin .
The skin in the face is thin , and it has big skin .
The skin on the back is invisible , with smaller skin .
One of the most importantly , the other part of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , but it 's not the same skin , no parts , no brain .
This system is also function of its function , the amount of its skin .
So here 's a screen screen to make my personal perspective , which is called the individual character of every day of architects and architects of @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ , between machine and organism , between industrial and growth ,
These two @@UNKNOWN@@ , my left and right brain , analysis and classic , are going to play on two two behind me .
Just like that , I work with these two @@UNKNOWN@@ together , and I 'm going to move from the @@UNKNOWN@@ and the growth .
You ask me , why now ?
Why was n't that 10 or five years ago ?
We live in a historical period of time , a extraordinary time , in the four areas of designers and designers have access to tools tools that we did n't have access access .
These areas are @@UNKNOWN@@ design that we can create complex shapes by using code code ; we can make 3D material that allows us to produce parts of using material , instead of @@UNKNOWN@@ , which we can make the
In the interface of this four areas , my team and I .
These are the head and hands of my students .
We design objects , products , structures and tools in all the terms of @@UNKNOWN@@ , like this @@UNKNOWN@@ with @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , with a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is going to produce all the buildings that are produced by
Here 's what we call @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , an ancient ancient ancient architecture , and we developed a grid in which each of the individual is unique , and the @@UNKNOWN@@ and the heat heat .
In our next project , we think of the possibility to create a @@UNKNOWN@@ and rock @@UNKNOWN@@ -- that was for a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ with @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ -- like a second skin , which is from a piece of
And with my @@UNKNOWN@@ 3D 3D @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , we @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and rock , without @@UNKNOWN@@ between the cells .
This guy 's @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ materials in @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That 's the resolution of a human hair and also the resolution of a visual @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And so that designers designers have access to these kinds of @@UNKNOWN@@ and mathematics , tools , they can make products products that are not just like our @@UNKNOWN@@ , but also the shape of our cells .
And then we did an industrial chair -- a chair with a structure , and at the same time .
A professor , my @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I looked for inspiration in nature .
We also put the surface with @@UNKNOWN@@ different properties , in @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ and color , the @@UNKNOWN@@ on the human body .
As in nature , the surface of its skin , not through the material or material , or @@UNKNOWN@@ , but by changing and @@UNKNOWN@@ change .
But is nature nature ?
Is there in nature ?
I did n't grew up in a @@UNKNOWN@@ Jewish party at home , but when I was young , I read my grandmother from the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I 'd like that , and I mean , that 's a
She told her , " The third @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ God had to make a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
The first @@UNKNOWN@@ should not be able to make a difference between the tribe , the leaves , leaves and leaves .
The whole tree was a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Instead , it took the country in @@UNKNOWN@@ trees , tribes and flowers .
The Earth created a world .
I often wonder , " How would design design when objects are made by a single part ?
Would we go back to a better @@UNKNOWN@@ ? "
We were looking for the @@UNKNOWN@@ material , a kind of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ material , and we found it .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ on the planet is @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and a half million hundred million million tons tons of organisms like @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
If we could make his properties , we could create @@UNKNOWN@@ structures from a part .
And we did .
We called " @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ " -- we @@UNKNOWN@@ a bunch of @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ them , and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
By the amount of what we 've got a large range of properties -- from dark , @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ to @@UNKNOWN@@ , and it 's transparent .
In order to make structures in large scale , we built a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ with a few pounds .
The robot @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and using the @@UNKNOWN@@ of a small structure of a material material to 100 percent @@UNKNOWN@@ .
When the parts are done , you can find it out , and they find it in touch with the air .
So why do we still do with plastic plastic ?
The @@UNKNOWN@@ , which were a @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , the first time ago , nine billion years ago , on the Earth , how we heard about yesterday .
With our @@UNKNOWN@@ at Harvard and at MIT , we built our genetic bacteria that would get out of the atmosphere in the atmosphere .
For the first time , we could create structures with @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , from @@UNKNOWN@@ to @@UNKNOWN@@ , and in scale scale .
A @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
With an ancient material , one of the first life on this planet , with natural water and some organic biology , we could have a structure of @@UNKNOWN@@ in a architecture that shape like a tree .
The best part of this is that it 's organic organic objects , when you have them in the sea , you can help them in the Earth , so they can grow a tree .
The environment of our next study , the same brain @@UNKNOWN@@ , was the solar system .
We were looking for a possibility to @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ for @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And we needed to use bacteria and their @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We developed our own jobs of the elements : new life grew grew up , and in addition to it , and we can produce .
And I 'm going to understand biology as a liquid fluid , just instead of @@UNKNOWN@@ , but you can create new biological functions in very small systems .
This is called @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We also put our own channels in 3D , control control across the river of the river .
In our first @@UNKNOWN@@ , we put two @@UNKNOWN@@ .
For a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They live in our oceans and in @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The second thing , again , the bacteria , the human gut .
One of the light in sugar , the other use of this sugar and produce @@UNKNOWN@@ , useful for the building environment .
These both interact interact with nature .
In fact , they did n't meet each other .
They 've been sent to the first time to put within within a @@UNKNOWN@@ in relationship .
Imagine it by evolution , not by natural selection , but evolution of design .
In order to have this room to have a space that we 've developed a single network that 's going to be able to see the @@UNKNOWN@@ and the function function .
And then we took these @@UNKNOWN@@ on the human body , ever after the way the @@UNKNOWN@@ works of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Where we wanted more to have more , we wanted to have more @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ is 60 feet long , if you do it .
That 's half as long as a @@UNKNOWN@@ , and 10 times as long as our @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And here at TED , this is the first time -- our first @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ with life in the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Thank you .
Mary @@UNKNOWN@@ said , " We are @@UNKNOWN@@ creatures , only half . "
What if the technology could be another half ?
If we could create structures , the living matter matter ?
What if we could personal personal personal system that could allow our skin to control the tissue to solve tissue tissue and our bodies ?
Imagine it a way of biology .
In this whole project , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , " after after the planet , it was not for me to make fashion designers , but she was an opportunity to think about the future of our way on our planet
I call it " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
We still have to go back to nature .
Now , you know , 3D 3D material in 3D material , and nature does n't make it .
It grows and growing up .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ creates an industrial architecture , a @@UNKNOWN@@ for the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
No three - dimensional idea comes up with this level .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ are not two materials , but two protein in different levels .
One of the structure as a structure , the other than the @@UNKNOWN@@ or the matrix , the @@UNKNOWN@@ together .
That happens in all the terms .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ itself out of their environment -- it creates an @@UNKNOWN@@ -- and it starts to make a pressure under pressure .
@@UNKNOWN@@ train , the two forces of life , @@UNKNOWN@@ in a single material .
In order to understand how this complex process works , we put a tiny @@UNKNOWN@@ on the head of the head of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We put them into a box with @@UNKNOWN@@ , which we can make 3D @@UNKNOWN@@ , and we see this complex architecture of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But when we started the @@UNKNOWN@@ on a level , not within a box , we found it , and it could also make a cold and @@UNKNOWN@@ it would be normal .
We created different environments , different @@UNKNOWN@@ , and we discovered that the shape that shape the structure of the brain is directly from the environment .
@@UNKNOWN@@ are going to be a lot of death , and they 're using their silk @@UNKNOWN@@ and in the industry .
By the design of this , we gave the @@UNKNOWN@@ of a form without a single way to cook .
They would be normal , and we could create these things .
So we make this process on @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We also make a robot out of silk , and they put it in our factory .
We knew the @@UNKNOWN@@ in @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ areas , so we use a @@UNKNOWN@@ diagram , and the distribution of light and heat into our structure .
We were able to get holes , and I grew up the light and heat heat , and the @@UNKNOWN@@ on the structure .
We were ready to get rid .
We @@UNKNOWN@@ six 500 @@UNKNOWN@@ of a online @@UNKNOWN@@ .
After four weeks , they were ready to go with us .
We put them up on the bottom of the bottom of the time .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ said that it was the great @@UNKNOWN@@ , and he was right .
In order to find biological silk about @@UNKNOWN@@ silk , which is going to be the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In two or three weeks , six or six weeks , six @@UNKNOWN@@ of 500 @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's also the same thing with the length of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
After them , they produce the @@UNKNOWN@@ and a half million eggs .
This could be able to give it to 250 others .
These are them , the two @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's a spider silk of an @@UNKNOWN@@ , the other skin the network .
If it 's the last border of design , the products of buildings , the buildings and buildings around us to create life , to create a @@UNKNOWN@@ material that we need to create these two @@UNKNOWN@@ together , which
A high thing with a new design age , a new age of design , which is inspired by nature -- design design to design design , which is that we need to take a mother .
Thank you .
Do you ask me , if you ever asked , " What do you want to be when you 're big ? "
And guess what you were , when you asked this question for the first time .
Just show it the fingers .
Three . Five . Three . Five . Five . Five .
Now please raise your hand if you ask the question , " What do you want to be when you 're big ? "
@@UNKNOWN@@ .
I 'm someone who could n't answer that question , " What do you want to be when you 're big ? "
The problem was not that I did n't have a interest interest -- it was more likely to have a lot .
In the high school , I liked English , mathematics and art and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I played the piano band of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Maybe you heard about us .
After the high school , it was going to go back , and I began to see a relationship with me , and one thing that I 'm interested in , and I 'm going to see it in a
Now , I 'm trying to keep it , because I 'm going to spend so much time and energy , and sometimes .
But finally , this feeling of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the feeling of it , " I understand it 's not a challenge . "
Then I have to move .
Then again , a little bit more of my interest , something completely different , and I @@UNKNOWN@@ myself in this subject , @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I think , " Yes ! I found my thing , and then I
And finally , I 'll give you the thing .
But then I @@UNKNOWN@@ something completely new and completely different .
This @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ a lot of fears in me , for two reasons .
The first thing I was n't sure I was just able to use one of my interest in the same way .
I thought I 'd have to choose something that everybody else 's @@UNKNOWN@@ and I 'm talking about the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The second reason for my fears was something personal .
I did n't worry about something that was wrong with me something wrong , because I could n't stop anything .
I was afraid that I was suffering from @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I was afraid , and I was afraid of my own career .
If you look at my story , and I feel like that I want you to ask you to ask a question that I 'd like to give myself back .
You know , where you 've learned what 's wrong or @@UNKNOWN@@ about it , lots of things .
I 'm going to tell you where you have learned that you have learned through our culture .
" What do you want to be when if you 're big ? " are we asked the first time when we 're about five years old .
In fact , no one of you , if you 're so young .
The question is , when you look at the point . You 're looking for small kids to get a few answers , and I want to say , " I want to be an " or " I want
Let 's take your @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But as we 're growing up , we 'll ask this question again , so many different ways -- how do you do high - school students , what you 're going to do when we 're going to think
And eventually , " What do you want to be when if you 're big ? "
Why ?
In the question of the children of children , they 'd like to think of what they might be inspired , and they were not trying to be able to protect what they could be .
In fact , she does exactly the opposite . If you ask someone what you want to do , you ca n't try to see 20 different answers .
You have to decide . "
This is Dr. Bob @@UNKNOWN@@ -- he 's @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This is Amy @@UNKNOWN@@ , just @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , an @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , teacher and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But most of the children do n't even know about these people .
They always hear that they have to decide .
But it 's more more .
The idea of a state of life is going to be in our culture .
It 's the idea of the purpose of the mind , or a real call , the idea that we all have in our time on this world for a big thing , and we need to figure out what
But what if you 're someone else 's different ?
What if you care about many different things and lots of different things ?
For people like you are not in this system .
That 's how you feel true .
They feel the feeling of your life .
And maybe you feel like this is not wrong with you .
It 's all with you .
They 're just a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
A @@UNKNOWN@@ is a person with a lot of interest and creative @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And you take the mouth very full .
Maybe it 's going to be able to do the term in three parts : @@UNKNOWN@@ , potential and potential .
Or you use one of the other words with similar meaning , like @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In the architect , the ideal , in many different places to be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ us .
Look for a term , or you do your own .
I 'm going to argue that I think it 's extremely accurate that our society ca n't be in a identity .
It 's easy to feel your @@UNKNOWN@@ as a @@UNKNOWN@@ , or when suffering , you have to fight .
But in the conversation with other people and through the writing for my website for my website , I 've learned that these properties also have a big amount of power .
I 'm going to give you three - three - year - olds .
One : @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This includes the combination of two or more parts of their @@UNKNOWN@@ , and they 're doing something new .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ on the site of both common interest , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , design and design , when they @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ by @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ had this unique idea , despite the way of the skills of skills and experiences .
And innovation innovation .
From there were new ideas .
@@UNKNOWN@@ can be able to scale up with lots of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The second version of @@UNKNOWN@@ is learning learning .
If you look at something about , they show it full .
We @@UNKNOWN@@ everything that we get in the hands .
We 're also used to be @@UNKNOWN@@ , as well as we 've been so often in the past .
The other thing you can do is a lot of skills that we need to do , and we do all of what we 've learned , in every new @@UNKNOWN@@ , which we 're going to do it at
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ is full - @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
When children were working with the incredible ability to create a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
You know , she 's the fastest @@UNKNOWN@@ that she knows .
But she was @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
She looked at it in terms of @@UNKNOWN@@ , when they were doing their practice , so that it helps you to help them into the developing form of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Now , it 's a lot of a half times a little bit of it , which makes you communicate , even if you 're at the end .
Maybe you can look at this in a very different field of how you never had @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The third one of the @@UNKNOWN@@ is @@UNKNOWN@@ . That 's the ability to turn into everything in a certain situation .
In @@UNKNOWN@@ , sometimes @@UNKNOWN@@ , sometimes @@UNKNOWN@@ , sometimes , for example , sometimes a teacher , and I 'm going to quote James James .
He 's going to say , because he 's good work .
He 's going to have more than it , because it can make different elements that ever after what his clients need .
The magazine , " @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ " as the most important capacity for the 21st century .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ changes , and so quickly , and the people that are going to be able to organize organizations , and that can be able to form the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , learning , and learning : three skills , the skills of skills that you can lose , if you 're going to do it .
And as a society , we have a self - interest interest in their self - interest .
Right now , there are lots of complex , @@UNKNOWN@@ problems in the world . We need creative creative people to do it .
Let 's think of your hearts .
In the fact , you were sure that you should be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Do n't worry about it .
In fact , some of the best team from a leader and a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ are things on the reason , and the ideas of ideas , as the @@UNKNOWN@@ are going to be able to create their @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It 's wonderful wonderful .
We all need to make life and career so that they make our brains .
Unfortunately , @@UNKNOWN@@ often often be more than their @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , if there 's one thing that you take from my talk , I hope it 's the following : Take your visual creatures , which always looks like .
If you 're in heart heart , you should be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
So you 're going to do your best work .
But the @@UNKNOWN@@ here , which are only in the last 12 minutes , that they 're saying -- I say , take all of a lot of them .
@@UNKNOWN@@ your response to the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ your @@UNKNOWN@@ .
You want to accept our nature to lead to a @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ life .
What maybe more important is -- @@UNKNOWN@@ , the world needs us .
Thank you .
@@UNKNOWN@@ was a woman called @@UNKNOWN@@ in a medical hospital .
@@UNKNOWN@@ had @@UNKNOWN@@ . She could n't remember the simplest details of their life .
The name of her @@UNKNOWN@@ was @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ did n't know how he could help help , but he was taking care of it , until @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
After her death , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ a @@UNKNOWN@@ , and found the strange @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ in the brain that he did n't even seen before this .
Really amazing .
Remember , today , we would have been able to be able to be able to be able to help them better than @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ was Dr. @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ the first patient , who has a disease that you have today today .
For @@UNKNOWN@@ , medicine has been done progress .
We 've been able to find antibiotics , and they discovered that many of HIV infections , a lot of cancer , breast cancer against HIV , @@UNKNOWN@@ disease and disease .
In the treatment of Alzheimer 's disease , we did n't have progress .
I 'm a group of scientists that have been used for about 10 years after a cure against Alzheimer 's disease .
So I always think about it .
Chris has been 40 million people around the world .
By 2050 , it will 150 150 million people -- which is a lot of you going to get through you .
If you hope to get five years or more likely to get your chance of Alzheimer 's disease , almost 50 percent .
In other words , it 's probably that you may be able to be able to be able to have Alzheimer 's disease or a Alzheimer 's Alzheimer 's or a friend .
In fact , in the United States , Alzheimer 's costs about 50 billion dollars a year .
The American health costs are a fifth of their lives for Alzheimer 's disease .
Now , Alzheimer 's disease is already the expensive disease and through the aging age of the generation generation to go to the end of 2050 .
It may be wondering that Alzheimer 's hope for our generation , just as one of the most important medical and social challenges .
But yet , we 've got a little bit about it .
From the 10 world of death in the world , Alzheimer 's disease is the only that we ca n't prevent , or whether or resistance .
We know less about Alzheimer 's disease about other diseases because we have less time and money in their lives .
The U.S. government is a year 10 times more than the cancer research than the research of Alzheimer 's disease , and it 's a little bit of Alzheimer 's disease , and we have a lot of deaths .
The missing resources have a cause cause , a lack of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Because just a few people know what everybody knows should be Alzheimer 's disease , and we can trust them .
Almost all over the last few years , it has been Alzheimer 's disease , all of scientists , @@UNKNOWN@@ with @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We thought it was a normal and @@UNKNOWN@@ part of the aging .
But we have to take pictures of a healthy brain brain with the brain of Alzheimer 's disease patients to see the actual physical damage that can be Alzheimer 's disease .
The damage of the brain does n't do it just by a loss loss of the intellectual skills and the memory , but it 's also the population population , and it 's always @@UNKNOWN@@ .
As I mentioned , John @@UNKNOWN@@ may have been able to be able to @@UNKNOWN@@ in some of the brain @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In the century , we did n't know much about it .
Today we know that this is @@UNKNOWN@@ .
A @@UNKNOWN@@ can imagine as a piece of paper which is usually the form of an @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
On the paper , @@UNKNOWN@@ points .
If it 's right now , there are these points at the end .
Sometimes it goes wrong and some of the points .
And this leads to the @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ , which eventually come up with large @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We see this in the brain of Alzheimer 's patients .
The last 10 years we 've been working at the University of Cambridge to learn how this works works .
For example , the amount of steps will be more complex than the @@UNKNOWN@@ of a bomb .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ of a @@UNKNOWN@@ changes may not even anything that happens in the rest of another .
We need to take the right step , and then the drug that it takes .
Until recently , we have @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and on the best .
But now , we have a @@UNKNOWN@@ team : doctors , biologists , biologists , biologists , engineers and engineers .
And together , we were able to create a very important @@UNKNOWN@@ , and we 're going to make a new kind of drugs that are just going to take this step , and then stop the disease .
These are some of our results results .
Nobody outside of our lab .
In these videos , you can see the effects of the drugs that have been done .
These are all healthy worms . They can recognize that they 're normal .
It 's in the opposite to these @@UNKNOWN@@ .
You can recognize that they 're clearly sick .
Let 's say that this is very early early the new drug , we can see that they are healthy and a normal life .
This is just a very good positive question , and it shows us this research , that Alzheimer 's disease is that we can understand and hope .
After a few years long , there 's a moment of hope on new species in the next 10 to 20 years , and the hope to prevent Alzheimer 's disease , we can help help .
It 's not about scientists like me -- it 's about you .
We 're going to ask you to control the moment of Alzheimer 's disease ; it 's a disease and we can control them if we 're trying to try it .
In other diseases , patients have their patients and their loved to research research research in the government , the @@UNKNOWN@@ , scientists and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This was critical to help the treatment of HIV in the late ' 80s .
Today we see the same activity in the fight against cancer .
Ladies patients are often not able to be able to @@UNKNOWN@@ themselves , and their families , the invisible victims , the day , and they loved their loved love , often often @@UNKNOWN@@ to make a change .
So it 's very close to you .
Now , Alzheimer 's has not a disease disease .
Who has a brain .
Today , there are 40 million patients , like @@UNKNOWN@@ , who do n't change the @@UNKNOWN@@ change .
Do n't give you a voice and ask you a cure .
Thank you .
I published an article in the @@UNKNOWN@@ ' School of the New York Times in January .
" Do you do that in life in love . "
In the article , it 's about a psychological study , the romantic love in the laboratory and to test the test of this study at the late night in the last summer .
The process is quite simple : Two people are asked to @@UNKNOWN@@ and a half - term questions , and instead of talking about four minutes in the eyes .
So here are some @@UNKNOWN@@ : 12 . And if you have to have a new quality or ability to beat up , what would that be ?
Seven . When did you go to the last time someone ever ?
And alone ?
As you see , the questions are always more personal .
The number is a little bit of me , tell your @@UNKNOWN@@ , which you 're talking about him ; it 's very honest , tell things that you 're not going to say so short .
When I first met a few years ago of this study , I 've been surprised with something very surprising , and that was the phrase that two of the children were six months later later , and the whole
And I realized , of course , very love for love , but I was very curious .
When I had a chance to study the study with an unexpected myself , I did n't expect to hear me .
But we have it , and ...
I thought that 's a good story , and I sent them a few months later on the ' @@UNKNOWN@@ .
She was published in January , and now we are now , so I think that some of you are wondering whether we 're together .
I think you ask me , because I asked this question in the last seven months .
Today I want to talk about these questions .
But then later .
In the last week , I was very nervous .
I 've been working on a book that I 've been working on a book about @@UNKNOWN@@ , so I used to talk about my @@UNKNOWN@@ in my blog .
A blog gets a couple of other words , and they were just using my Facebook friends and I thought that my New York Times Times a few thousand people .
It felt like a lot of attention for a fresh relationship .
As it turns out , I was something wrong .
@@UNKNOWN@@ was on a @@UNKNOWN@@ online , and so I looked at the @@UNKNOWN@@ on my blog .
Until @@UNKNOWN@@ , the four - day - day show and Good morning America .
Within a month , the eight eight million @@UNKNOWN@@ and I was to make it more @@UNKNOWN@@ , for those kinds of attention .
One thing is , right and honest about his @@UNKNOWN@@ , something completely different is it , but to find out that your life in the @@UNKNOWN@@ has been done . And people are all around the world , and
If people ask you for every day , you ask them , first of all , the same thing : Are they still together ?
In fact , I 'm going to talk to this talk quickly quickly , if you 're going to go back to your face ? "
They came from students and journalists and wonderful people like this .
I gave them up and asked them .
I gave a talk and a woman called " Hey @@UNKNOWN@@ , where is your friend ? "
I was immediately @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I understand that the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
If you think about his relationship in an international newspaper , you should see that people do n't help you yet .
But that I was n't just ready to do that .
They did n't agree with them .
The New York Times published a new article of this subject to the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the experiences of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , the experiment with different @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Because of course , that attention was my first process to @@UNKNOWN@@ my relationship .
I told each other of us that we would both get us when we were going to connect together .
I said , " @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and @@UNKNOWN@@ every generation of photos .
And I think I was afraid of @@UNKNOWN@@ , " How do you get -- @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , which I did n't feel myself .
And I understand it : people did n't just want to know whether the study works , whether it really works , if it really works , if you can actually create real love , not just a funny ,
But this was a question that I could n't answer .
My relationship was just a few months ago , and I had the feeling that people were missing the wrong questions .
What would it really say if we are still together or not ?
If the answer is no , that would experience the experience with the @@UNKNOWN@@ of less @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
Dr. @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ wrote about these questions in the study of @@UNKNOWN@@ , and there was the goal to not love romantic love .
Instead , they wanted to increase the relationship relationship with students in terms of what @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , personal @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Stop , how ?
But the study has worked .
The participants felt that they were connected with each other , and lots of @@UNKNOWN@@ have been @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ to make a few stranger .
He was used to @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ and people with people who have political political views .
On the @@UNKNOWN@@ story of the story , the last summer I 've been working with the personal questions with @@UNKNOWN@@ eye , was in this article , but unfortunately never .
A few months ago , I gave a talk about a little @@UNKNOWN@@ , and a student came up to me , and I said , " I 've done the study , and it did n't work . "
He seemed something like this .
" You mean , you did n't love you in love ? "
" Well , " " he said .
" I think she wants to be friends . "
" But are you better friends ? " I asked .
" Do you feel that you 're going to show you the study . "
He @@UNKNOWN@@ .
" Then it works . "
That 's not the answer that he expected .
I do . I do n't want to answer that answer if it comes to love .
I met on this study when I was 29 , so I was just a very hard way .
I was in the relationship that I had 20 years ago , which was pretty much my life of my life . He was my first big love and I did n't know , or whether I could n't live
So I turned to science .
I 've been interested in science in science all about @@UNKNOWN@@ love , and I 'd like to think it would be my breath .
I do n't know if I realized it at the time -- I thought that I was just reading my book -- but it 's very obvious .
I hope that when I realized with my love of love , and I never never felt so terrible and so much like my life .
All the knowledge was useful in some way .
I 'm a @@UNKNOWN@@ in love . I 'm more more .
I 'm optimistic about what I want .
But I can see myself in a little bit more , and I 'm going to say more than something that needs to be necessary .
So what I want to love from love , is an incredible not just to talk to you today , or also , tomorrow , but that person who I love to love is also for love .
Maybe it 's this possibility of an important thing that people are saying , if they ask , whether we 're together ?
The story that the media told me about half the questions was that there might be a half of the love .
Maybe you could be able to get the risks risks , and that 's very powerful , because it sounds beautiful , but it 's also scary .
In the moment , you have to love his love , you have to lose a lot of weight , and it 's true that these questions have an instrument to be able to learn from your own , or
But I think if it comes to love , we 're going to be willing to fight the story of history .
The version of the story , the question , " Are you going to go together ? " and you do n't stand up with you ?
Instead , instead , instead of asking questions , questions like , how do you choose to make our love and not ?
How do you live in love , if problems and how do you know when it 's time to love love ?
How do you live with the @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is going to stop in any relationship , or even harder , how do you live with the @@UNKNOWN@@ of his mind ?
I do n't know what you 're saying , but I think they 're important to talk about what it means to love someone .
So if you want me , the @@UNKNOWN@@ of my relationship is a year ago , and I made a @@UNKNOWN@@ , the romantic love , and we love with love , we 're still together , and I 'm
@@UNKNOWN@@ to do n't love the same thing with love .
@@UNKNOWN@@ to love is the simple part .
At the end of my article , I wrote , " love is not happening .
We 're in love , because we decided to do it . "
It 's just a little bit of science when I do n't read it because it 's not true , but because I did n't really have to take all the time out what the choice did .
I do n't have thought , as many of us all of us have to do this choice , and how often do I have to have to choose that choice without any other , whether it seems to choose
I wanted to say that the Three questions and answers that I have more choice to make a @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I love to love , and I 'm going to get that up in the largest world .
Instead , I have changed the relationship in a myth that I do n't think about it .
What I 'm going to think about my entire life is that this myth is true .
I want this @@UNKNOWN@@ that the title of my article , which is the only part I 'm not doing .
Instead , I have the chance to make a choice to love someone and the hope that he love my love , and that 's scary , but it 's in love .
I grew up with two mothers in the mountains , and came up as a kind of New York City .
It took me to see the mind -- but later later .
I 'm going to start when I was eight years old , I took a @@UNKNOWN@@ , I would take a dollar - a - a - a - a - a - a - a - a - a
It seems to be hundreds of 500 years ago , and something about the way we think of our species ideas like we eat , I did n't have a real idea .
It 's funny . Because now , 30 years later , I 'm still working with boxes .
And finally , I was going to live in mountains -- I like @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ -- and I made a @@UNKNOWN@@ for my mother .
And I took a dictionary and @@UNKNOWN@@ it , and I made a kind of a little bit out of it , and I put it on a lot of it , and I have a lot of it ,
My mother was afraid of bees , and it 's even @@UNKNOWN@@ , so I @@UNKNOWN@@ more @@UNKNOWN@@ about the screen to hide the bees .
The opposite was the case . The bees was kind of larger than a @@UNKNOWN@@ on the text .
What did I make it more ?
And this time , I took electronics , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ -- -- all , what I found -- because I always found something and trying to draw the objects .
I saw them around him , and I realized , " Wow ! I can paint in the air !
I can go open - up lines like the world around you .
So I took the things out , and I made my own @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
First : @@UNKNOWN@@ -- this is also quite easy .
Then , funny insects and creatures .
This was really great ; I just just looked at @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That was cool , because I began to show show , and so what I do . I was making money with my friend .
That was really @@UNKNOWN@@ .
And finally , I came up with people , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ with @@UNKNOWN@@ .
That was also great , except I was going to die .
I did n't know what I should do , which I could have killed me .
I thought every night .
I tried to do it with @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I started looking at them when I took on a window , and then you take another another , and then another thing , and then again , so the same
And this did work , I did n't need any more .
That 's what I did for years ago . That 's a great collection that I call " The @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
It was inspired by @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , " The garden of the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , " the painting in @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in Spain .
Does anybody know ?
Good , that 's a cool work .
So let 's go ahead .
" The @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
It 's almost 11 tons of hard time , five feet long , @@UNKNOWN@@ , so 11 meters of art , quite unusual .
That 's the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
On the left , they call the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
There 's a cave , in the @@UNKNOWN@@ with two - dimensional worlds .
They go from the @@UNKNOWN@@ world in a @@UNKNOWN@@ , where they hide .
Here they are , and they want to make @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The ocean is from thousands of elements .
Here 's a @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ on a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , also , in the ocean , the horizon of the oil industry , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ .
This is a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It comes from the water and oil oil in a hand , and clouds come from the other .
Their hands are like @@UNKNOWN@@ , and she has @@UNKNOWN@@ to the balance between the Earth .
This is the site of the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
A little story .
This is her hand in her .
And then on the other hand , she has come back to the clouds .
She has a five feet long , the @@UNKNOWN@@ " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
The tail starts fire .
I do n't know why .
That happens .
The tail end up in a @@UNKNOWN@@ eye , which is made by @@UNKNOWN@@ terrorists .
Anybody do that ?
The ones come from the 80s , @@UNKNOWN@@ with terrorists .
Really your time .
That brings us to my latest project .
I 'm just in two : One of them is " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
It takes so six years until you have 100 of these people .
Every one is a archive of our culture through the @@UNKNOWN@@ of music , they 're @@UNKNOWN@@ , dictionaries or dictionaries .
Everyone is a kind of archive in @@UNKNOWN@@ , they come in groups , 20 , four , or 12 .
They 're like cells -- they come together and share .
As a mirror , it takes me to do it .
Every piece is like a microscope , @@UNKNOWN@@ with a human inside .
He 's got a @@UNKNOWN@@ in the chest .
This is his head ; there 's the breast you can see the beginning .
We just go down to the body : a bar comes from the chest , it 's going to be @@UNKNOWN@@ -- or not -- weak , or whatever it is , something @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We 're doing this in the process , because I ca n't afford every single day .
There are the layers that you see .
That 's a body that 's shared .
This one has two people , and talking between them .
You can see the library that are going on the other head .
Here 's a small forest scene .
Is you thinking ?
Well , this talk is a little bit like boxes , which we put together .
This box here , which is also one .
That brings me to my last box .
A @@UNKNOWN@@ box called " @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
In this box , a physicist , a psychologist , a painter , a musicians , a writer , a @@UNKNOWN@@ , a museum , a museum , a school , a @@UNKNOWN@@ , which we 're doing inside the
We 're going to make this box , and all of the people inside people inside a little bit of little particles .
And I think that should be changing the world .
You define the content and the box that you live in .
And then you come together and realize , " Hey , we 're all sitting here . "
We 're all from the same , sitting in the same box .
And if we do n't do it , and we 're going to die , we die all very quickly .
Thank you .
What do you do if you have a mouse ?
They eat a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But before the brain that happens in the head where there is the pain , it 's going to get through the gut , the gut and other organs .
@@UNKNOWN@@ are the most effective and @@UNKNOWN@@ way to make the body a drug .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ of a drug also always goes to the same thing .
And this is a big problem , especially in HIV patients .
The drugs are going to prevent the HIV virus is good at the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the blood in the blood , and the rise of the number of @@UNKNOWN@@ , but they 're also known for their @@UNKNOWN@@ effects ,
In the parts of the body , like , for example , the nodes , the nervous system , and the lungs , the virus , or the virus virus , and it does n't get rid of the blood
But the treatment is going to be used to be able to prevent the virus , and then you can get the brain cells .
All of this leads to global problems with the current HIV - based drugs that have to be treated by the patients .
One day , I sat down , and I thought , " Could you do the HIV drug do n't directly in the HIV - @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , without danger , the drug would be @@UNKNOWN@@ ? "
As a laser scientist , the answer to the hand was with , of course .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , in terms of @@UNKNOWN@@ , diabetes , diabetes , and in surgery , they can use it for all of it , even for the production of drugs to the cells .
In fact , in fact , we 're going to start at @@UNKNOWN@@ , to see the black holes in the cells , and they 're able to break it down , and they 're almost almost open up and
" How is that possible ? "
We have a very strong , but @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ on the skin of HIV HIV cells , they 're in a fluid with the drug .
The laser shows the cell , and it takes the drug within the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Before you notice it 's the hole again .
At the moment , we 're going to test this process in @@UNKNOWN@@ or in @@UNKNOWN@@ , but it 's the technology of the human body .
They like , how do you do it ?
The answer is .
With the first head , the laser , we make a @@UNKNOWN@@ on the area of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the camera that we 're moving to this place .
With the third head , a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ to the distribution , we 're going to use the drug directly to the @@UNKNOWN@@ . The laser is going to @@UNKNOWN@@ back to the cell cells .
Now , maybe that 's not just a lot of it .
But in the @@UNKNOWN@@ of technology , this technology can be a single day of life - known virus .
A cure against HIV .
The dream of one HIV HIV -- in our case , a cure by laser .
Thank you .
For over a decade , I do n't study -- no , local groups , groups groups , including organizations , terrorists and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I @@UNKNOWN@@ what these groups do when they do n't listen to someone .
My goal is to get these religious actors , and to find ways to create the transition from the battle of the fight .
I work in the politics and in the library .
These groups groups understand that 's the key to solve the most current conflict , because the war has changed .
A war is no longer a competition between states like that .
He 's a conflict between states and not - @@UNKNOWN@@ government .
For example , one of the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , which was in between 2011 and 2011 , and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ between a state and a non - state government .
So we have to understand these groups ; we need to open them or control into every process at the conflict that we need .
So how do we do that ?
We need to know how these organizations are .
We know a lot about how they fight and why , but nobody looks at what they do when they do n't fight .
But civil struggle and democracy politics are connected .
It 's all part of the same organization .
We ca n't understand these groups , even if we do n't see the big world .
And groups groups are complex organizations .
Take the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , known for their @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ with Israel .
But for her , in the early 90s , the @@UNKNOWN@@ has a political party , a @@UNKNOWN@@ , and a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
It was @@UNKNOWN@@ - @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , who has known for their @@UNKNOWN@@ against Israel , the @@UNKNOWN@@ in 2007 .
So , these groups do more than just thousands .
They do .
They create complex @@UNKNOWN@@ -- @@UNKNOWN@@ , TV , @@UNKNOWN@@ and social media .
And here we have the @@UNKNOWN@@ magazine , in English , and published published .
@@UNKNOWN@@ groups can also invest in complex @@UNKNOWN@@ -- no @@UNKNOWN@@ , but the @@UNKNOWN@@ companies , @@UNKNOWN@@ , for example .
These action are the key .
So , these groups can produce their strength , their resources , better and create a brand .
@@UNKNOWN@@ groups are still doing something else : They build large connections with people who are trying to invest in @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They build schools , @@UNKNOWN@@ hospitals , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ or @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ all of these services and more .
@@UNKNOWN@@ groups , the population on their side with one , which is the state , not the security .
The rise of the Taliban in the middle of the war in Afghanistan , or even the beginning of the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , is so important to the effort of these groups , security security .
Unfortunately , the population in those cases have to be a very high price of security .
But in general , the @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ a gap , one of the government open to the gap , and it allows these groups to power their power and their power .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ of the nation - @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of 2006 could n't be understood , without the social work of the group .
Now we have a really complex picture , but we 're looking at the West on groups groups , we just think about the same side .
But that 's not enough to understand the power of these groups , their strategy or @@UNKNOWN@@ .
These groups make a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They go up , because they make a gap of government , and they 're both both the same as a leader , and they 're involved in the fight and fight a leader .
And the more complex and more of these organizations , the less we see them as the opposite of the state .
How do you call it a group like @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
They lead to a part of an area , all of their functions , @@UNKNOWN@@ the waste , the system .
Is that a state ? Is it a @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
Or maybe something else , weird and new ?
And what about the @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
The boundaries are not .
We live in a world of states , non - states , and in the middle of the world and the more states , like today in the Middle East , the more non - @@UNKNOWN@@ actors , and we
That 's important for governments . Because for those groups , they 're going to do more in the military military tools .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ of this gap needs to be a sustainable approach .
It 's also very important for @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
If we 're going to understand groups groups , we need to know better than what we need to give to change the transition of violence to peace .
So , in this new competition between states and non - three - power power , some force are going to win , but it will not be able to make peace peace .
In order to do this goals , we need a @@UNKNOWN@@ to the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , for the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ , which has to allow these groups to be able to do it .
Thank you very much .
I @@UNKNOWN@@ as a woman , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I believe out of the heart of hearts , but I 'm afraid that it 's not good good news .
I 'm a feminist , but a more bad thing .
So I call it a bad @@UNKNOWN@@ .
At least , I wrote an article , a book called " @@UNKNOWN@@ and " I became in the " @@UNKNOWN@@ " The bad @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
So what kind of humor was like humor and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ began , a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I want to go back .
When I was younger , until I was in my back , I asked myself a kind of @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ women , as if the thing was bad .
Today , I 'm thinking about how women are going to be treated , and especially anger seems to be completely wrong .
But then again , the sound of people who were when she was @@UNKNOWN@@ that I could be a perfect .
When I call it a @@UNKNOWN@@ , it was a funny word , and it 's not a nice thing .
I was known as a woman who does n't stop at the rules that have to be much more likely to think about it because I believe it too much better than better than a man .
@@UNKNOWN@@ wants to be this @@UNKNOWN@@ , until you realize that you 're exactly the @@UNKNOWN@@ , and you can not imagine someone else .
When I was older , I realized that I actually am a feminist , and I 'm a proud .
I 'm really important to say that women are men .
We make the same thing for the same work .
We have the right to keep in the world with no fear of violence or violence .
We have the right to be able to get access access to @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We have the right to control our body , without @@UNKNOWN@@ or @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We have a right to respect .
And more more .
If we want to talk about the needs of women , we need to keep all the other stories that we live .
We 're not only women .
We are people with different bodies , @@UNKNOWN@@ , faith , @@UNKNOWN@@ , from different layers , with other skills and more .
We need to think of these differences and how they affect us as much as our minds .
Without this kind of thing , our wife is nothing .
I think that these things for granted , but to be very clear , I 'm @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I was full of @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I do so many things wrong with my wife .
I have to say something .
When I go to work , I hear very , very strange .
Even though the text women are writing -- these books are inspired me -- as the classic @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ -- which is great .
" @@UNKNOWN@@ , what you did in your shirt shirt .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ your @@UNKNOWN@@ , until it @@UNKNOWN@@ up . "
Think about it .
@@UNKNOWN@@ , right ?
My @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I believe in @@UNKNOWN@@ , which is what I do n't want to do what I do n't want , like -- all kinds of @@UNKNOWN@@ , but also , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I do n't have to do anything .
@@UNKNOWN@@ is my @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I love @@UNKNOWN@@ and beautiful things .
I see , " The @@UNKNOWN@@ , " and romantic @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I 've made an idea of what they would say .
Some of my @@UNKNOWN@@ are still @@UNKNOWN@@ .
If one woman does the name of her husband , she 's going to make the choice , and I did n't have to judge it .
If a woman 's going to be a woman , you want to children their children , then I accept that choice .
The problem is not that it does n't make economic sense , because the problem is that our society do n't need to be sustainable economic growth when they decide .
That 's what we should do .
I 'm going to @@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ , who 's in the history of the world 's not - white white , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ women , or @@UNKNOWN@@ , to white white @@UNKNOWN@@ or @@UNKNOWN@@ .
If it 's good , I 'm a really bad hero .
And then , as a sad , I 'm constantly constantly under the pressure .
We tend to look at the @@UNKNOWN@@ of a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We expect to make them perfect .
If they @@UNKNOWN@@ us , we @@UNKNOWN@@ them back from the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
As I said , I 'm completely @@UNKNOWN@@ . @@UNKNOWN@@ me , as you just , before you 're just trying to try me .
A lot of women , all of the things , women and women who are afraid of being called @@UNKNOWN@@ .
They 're afraid and say , " Yeah , I 'm a feminist , " @@UNKNOWN@@ fear , which is why this term , fear , is not going to be optimistic .
For example , for example , or how I call them , they 're the @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In the last few years , she has evolved to become a physical paradigm .
In the course of the video video @@UNKNOWN@@ , she won the three - foot @@UNKNOWN@@ , " @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
It was a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and I see a beautiful time looking at her @@UNKNOWN@@ , and young women and men know men to be a reason to celebrate .
In the course of @@UNKNOWN@@ , they talked about the debate , even though , actually , was actually a feminist .
She @@UNKNOWN@@ her wife , instead of an adult , @@UNKNOWN@@ woman with the word .
We 're thinking about @@UNKNOWN@@ , because we 're still going to fight so much , so much like that , you need a lot .
We 're going to go beyond far - @@UNKNOWN@@ , sorry , if we 're going to get rid of each other , and we do n't get anything about it .
We do n't need that .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ -- and it 's a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But what happens next ?
If we have to accept our mistakes , we need to take @@UNKNOWN@@ , we can talk about the words , and a little bit of it .
If I hear music music , I 'm going to have to demand a demand for the artists of love to continue .
These artists are n't going to change anything about how they talk about women in their songs , and we just do that by giving them by making their profit .
Of course , it 's hard .
Why does that have to get into the ear ?
It 's hard to make a better choice and so easy to make a sense .
But -- if I do a bad choice , I 'm going to do it to women and women , and we have to make all of it , and I have to recognize it .
I think about my @@UNKNOWN@@ , three and four years old .
They 're @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ and great girls , who are smart .
I want them to live in a world where they are as the powerful creatures that they are .
I think of it , and suddenly it gets better better than that .
We can make a better choice .
We can change the network , which is a TV series of sexual violence against women like @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
We can change the radio , when we hear songs , which are women who are going to do nothing .
We can spend our @@UNKNOWN@@ in the world when films were only more than objects objects .
We can stop @@UNKNOWN@@ , if you want to protect their partners like a @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Otherwise , men can say -- and especially white white says , " No , I 'm not going to give you in your magazine , or at your project , or you do n't work with you , until
I 'm not going to work with my own or an organization or an organization or not open to all sorts of people . "
Those of us who are @@UNKNOWN@@ , and in those projects , are also going to be a little bit further from us , and we do n't have any symbols .
Without these effort , without @@UNKNOWN@@ , we 'll just get very little .
We can get these little , steps steps and hope that our choice for the top of the @@UNKNOWN@@ -- the @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ , people -- the people , @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ elections , to
We can also share with our wife -- whether good , bad or somewhere in between .
The last sentence of my book said , " My @@UNKNOWN@@ , " " I 'm going to be a bad enemy than not . "
This is from several reasons , but before all of the things , because I 'd come up with a long time before my voice , and he helped me , again .
There was an event .
I call it an event that I 'm going to use the load of what 's going on .
A couple of times , when I was too young , to know what guys do , to give a girl .
They treated me when I was @@UNKNOWN@@ .
I started thinking that I was @@UNKNOWN@@ .
She @@UNKNOWN@@ my voice , and later , I do n't believe that something I said , meaning .
But -- I had writing writing .
And then I wrote back again .
I wrote myself to a stronger version of my own .
I read the words of women who have a story like my understanding , and women , which I looked like , and I understand what it means with the skin with the skin .
I read the words of women who gave me that I did n't .
I learned how to write , and then I learned how to write myself .
I found my voice again , and I started thinking that my voice was all the potential .
In writing and @@UNKNOWN@@ , I found that if I was a little bit of a person who would hear me another , and I could n't understand that it 's not like us to be @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In one hand , I hope to make power .
In the other people I think the truth is that I 'm just a single woman .
I 'm a bad note . I 'm a good woman . I 'm going to be able to see what I think and what I say , and what I do , without everything I 'm going to do
I hope we can all .
I hope that we can all be a little bit of it if we need to help the courage .
The last year , after after a day , children @@UNKNOWN@@ children in California who were going to go back to a visit in the @@UNKNOWN@@ , or in touch with someone who was there .
The virus came over to Canada and HIV more than 100 children in it .
The @@UNKNOWN@@ thing about this oil is that @@UNKNOWN@@ for a child with the immune system to be immune to the immune system , but it 's one of the most powerful disease .
It 's a vaccine vaccine for over 50 years , but a lot of children of the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ were not @@UNKNOWN@@ , because their parents were @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
But it was n't the published that the debate about autism and @@UNKNOWN@@ , from the British University of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and as @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
You know , most of people who know that theory theory is that it has to be autism , is it ?
Most of you know it , but millions of the world have always been afraid that they 're talking to autism with their children .
Why ?
I want to explain it .
This graph shows that the rise of autism is growing up .
In the 20th century .
The few psychologist and @@UNKNOWN@@ who had heard this , they thought they would n't live in their entire life .
For decades , the rise rate down to three or four children from 10 .
But in the 1990s , this number happened .
@@UNKNOWN@@ organizations , like @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , called autism as an epidemic , as if you just wanted to go to a visit in India .
So what 's happened ?
If it 's not the chance , what 's it ?
If you ask the people in the American @@UNKNOWN@@ Center in New York , like this , it can say something like " @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ " and " @@UNKNOWN@@ " to explain these numbers .
But this issue is not the fear of a young mother , the eye eye with their @@UNKNOWN@@ .
When the @@UNKNOWN@@ were going to have to increase why they were so close ?
Why did n't you find the 1990s in the 1990s ?
Five years ago , I decided to look at these questions .
And I found that the cause of less in the slow and the progress of science as science in the power power of history .
The doctors told a story about what was autism and how it was discovered , but this story was just wrong , and the result was a global impact on global global health .
There was a second , more story , which was in a dark corner of the literature literature and literature .
The second story told us what happened , and how to go on .
The first story starts with a @@UNKNOWN@@ called @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in John @@UNKNOWN@@ .
In fact , @@UNKNOWN@@ published a article , in the 11 young patients , who were living in their own world , and the people around them , and they were all talking about their own parents .
They work for hours , just by the face of the face in the hands , but they 're going through a lot of @@UNKNOWN@@ , if you think of their @@UNKNOWN@@ without their knowledge .
In the patients , patients in the hospital , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , that autism is very rare .
Now , as an expert on this area , he had to go back in the 1990s for less than 150 conditions , " he said , " @@UNKNOWN@@ , " and that , even though , from all the
That 's not surprising , because @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ for a @@UNKNOWN@@ were very @@UNKNOWN@@ .
For example , children children had @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , but they 're very different .
He @@UNKNOWN@@ him that he could nine nine of the children who were born by other people who were born .
@@UNKNOWN@@ was a smart person , but some of his theories were wrong .
He @@UNKNOWN@@ autism as a form of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , which was cold by @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ parents .
These children , so he said , living in a toilet that never has been @@UNKNOWN@@ .
At the same time , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ that some of his young patients had had different skills in particular areas , like music , mathematics or memory .
A boy in his hospital could 18 18 @@UNKNOWN@@ before before he was two years old .
If his mother one of his @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , he said , " @@UNKNOWN@@ ! "
But @@UNKNOWN@@ played the skills of it , he said that these children were just @@UNKNOWN@@ , which their parents parents said , to recognize their wisdom .
So this was a lot of autism who had been made for the families of @@UNKNOWN@@ , who had been a @@UNKNOWN@@ , and two generations of children have become their best in @@UNKNOWN@@ , and so invisible to the
And in the 1970s , scientists have started to theory theory that it was very rare .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , a @@UNKNOWN@@ in London , in the opinion , @@UNKNOWN@@ theory about the @@UNKNOWN@@ parents , " she said .
They were her husband and John people , and they had a high - year - old daughter , @@UNKNOWN@@ .
The two knew how hard it was to be a kid like @@UNKNOWN@@ , without @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and other people who ca n't have access to people .
In order to think of the great health of arguments , for example , for child children and their children have to support more support , they @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and their colleagues , who have been done 30 years
They studied the rise of autism in the population .
They @@UNKNOWN@@ the London @@UNKNOWN@@ to find children in children .
They were showing that the model model was very closely at the same time when the real brain had a lot of autism and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Some of children could n't speak , during other words about dinosaurs , dinosaurs or @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
These children do n't think in any of them , so @@UNKNOWN@@ , and they saw a lot of children , more much more than the @@UNKNOWN@@ model model .
First of all , they did n't know how to take this data .
How could it be that children did n't notice it ?
But then a lot of a evidence on an article that was published in the year - year - old @@UNKNOWN@@ , a year after @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and then she had @@UNKNOWN@@ -- and she had a terrible time
@@UNKNOWN@@ knew about this @@UNKNOWN@@ article , but @@UNKNOWN@@ it very carefully to do this in his own work .
He was never going to talk to English language , but fortunately , she was @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and she wrote the article for them .
The article gave an alternative description of autism .
The author , a man called @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , which led to the @@UNKNOWN@@ in a @@UNKNOWN@@ from hospital and @@UNKNOWN@@ .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ for children with children were @@UNKNOWN@@ , even for the time .
The day started at his hospital with @@UNKNOWN@@ music , and playing @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
Instead , after the parents who give the cause of the autism for the brain , it seems like a disease , @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , the collective support and @@UNKNOWN@@ during the entire life .
Instead of children children in his hospital like patients to treat patients , they called his " little @@UNKNOWN@@ , and they won their help for the development of @@UNKNOWN@@ , which were especially for them .
@@UNKNOWN@@ looked at the same time as @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , with an incredible @@UNKNOWN@@ between us and mental .
He believed that autism and autism also have a lot of them , and they 've been always talking about it , and he looked at this particular thing to be known as known as known as popular as a
He was even the opinion that success in art and science should be a lot of autism .
@@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ realized that the @@UNKNOWN@@ of autism and autism @@UNKNOWN@@ through the parents .
In the next few years , they worked with the American @@UNKNOWN@@ of society @@UNKNOWN@@ to @@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ and the diversity of them , which they called " @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ . "
In the late ' 60s , early years ago , their changes were effective . @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ model against @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ model .
These changes happened in a vacuum .
So , during @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ behind the @@UNKNOWN@@ , the people looked at the same people in the world .
In the film , " You said , " in the year , she was just a tiny circle of experts , which was autism before , but after the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , you
So at the same time , there were the first simple clinical trials to allow autism to autism .
You did n't need to touch a little bit of this little @@UNKNOWN@@ , so that kid had a kid .
The combination of " @@UNKNOWN@@ , " which changed the results and the test of these tests have a network of the network , a @@UNKNOWN@@ of circumstances , the autism in mind .
The number of the @@UNKNOWN@@ came up , like @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ it , yes , it had to be able to be able to protect their families and support the families , and they decided to give them the
Then he @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , and he wrote the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the chance to make a simple , powerful , @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , which was so wrong with @@UNKNOWN@@ theory that was so rare .
If the estimate of the B is correct , one of the kids in the United States is the most one of the most largest world of the world .
In the last few years , people live in the Internet , the idea of @@UNKNOWN@@ , they have puzzles that you have to help with help of a medical @@UNKNOWN@@ , and @@UNKNOWN@@ the term .
The human brain is to compare it to a different way to understand .
Just because a computer does n't have a toilet that does n't mean that it 's broken .
After the same scale , the normal human brain is easy to @@UNKNOWN@@ , and social , has the bad to look at detail .
People have it very hard . They live in a world which is not for them .
70 years later , and we 're still trying to figure out what they 've been thinking about @@UNKNOWN@@ , who believed that the " @@UNKNOWN@@ , " which is most of the most common @@UNKNOWN@@ of the language through
One - year - old woman named @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ said , " We need all of the guy on deck , to meet the ship of humanity .
We 're going to @@UNKNOWN@@ in a future future , which we need every form of human intelligence on the planet , in the parts of the tasks that we have .
We can not afford to make a brain . "
Thank you .
